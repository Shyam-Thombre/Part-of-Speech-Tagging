            "actual words: UNK international corp. 's tulsa unit said it signed a tentative agreement UNK its contract with boeing co. to provide structural parts for boeing 's 747 UNK . UNK said the agreement calls for it to supply 200 additional so-called UNK for the planes . these include , among other parts , each jetliner 's two major UNK , a pressure floor , UNK box , fixed leading UNK for the UNK and an UNK UNK UNK . under the existing contract , UNK said , it has already delivered UNK of the UNK to boeing . UNK , based in el segundo , calif. , is an aerospace , electronics , automotive and graphics concern . frank UNK iii was named to this telecommunications company 's board , filling the vacancy created by the death of william UNK last may . mr. UNK , 59 years old , served as defense secretary in the reagan administration . in january , he accepted the position of vice chairman of UNK group , a merchant banking concern . shearson lehman hutton inc . thomas e. UNK , 42 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of UNK co. , a UNK , ill. , subsidiary of this new york investment banking firm . UNK , which has interests in real estate , said the position is newly created . mr. UNK had been executive vice president of UNK . in addition to his previous real-estate investment and UNK duties , mr. UNK takes responsibility for development and property management . those duties had been held by van UNK , 44 , who resigned as an executive vice president . shearson is about UNK by american express co . great american bank , citing depressed arizona real estate prices , posted a third-quarter loss of $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share . a year earlier , the savings bank had earnings of $ 8.1 million , or 33 cents a share . for the nine months , it had a loss of $ UNK million , or $ 2.44 a share , after earnings of $ UNK million , or $ 1.20 a share , in the 1988 period . great american said it increased its loan-loss reserves by $ 93 million after reviewing its loan portfolio , raising its total loan and real estate reserves to $ 217 million . before the loan-loss addition , it said , it had operating profit of $ 10 million for the quarter . the move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against arizona real estate loans , reflecting a continuing decline in that market . in addition to the increased reserve , the savings bank took a special charge of $ 5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters , and it posted a $ 7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage UNK fees , reflecting the fact that more borrowers are UNK their mortgages . UNK were n't the only big losers in the collapse of ual corp. stock . look at what happened to ual 's chairman , stephen m. wolf , and its chief financial officer , john c. pope . on a day some united airlines employees wanted mr. wolf fired and takeover stock speculators wanted his UNK , messrs. wolf and pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of ual , united 's parent company , UNK $ UNK on the big board to close at $ 198 . including monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ UNK million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of ual gone through at $ 300 a share . when bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week , so did ual 's stock . even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $ 250 a share , the two executives would still get about $ 25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction . mr. wolf owns 75,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 250,000 at $ UNK each . in the $ 300-a-share UNK , that totaled about $ 76.7 million . by yesterday 's close of trading , it was good for a UNK $ 43.5 million . of course , mr. wolf , 48 years old , has some savings . he left his last two jobs at republic airlines and flying tiger with combined UNK gains of about $ 22 million , and ual gave him a $ 15 million bonus when it hired him . his 1988 salary was $ UNK , with a $ UNK bonus . the UNK old mr. pope has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to UNK away that kind of money . united paid him a $ UNK bonus to lure him away from american airlines , and he was paid a salary of $ UNK last year with a $ UNK bonus . mr. pope owns 10,000 ual shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $ 69 each . that came to a combined $ UNK million under the $ 300-a-share buy-out , but just $ 21.3 million at yesterday 's close . of the combined $ 114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out , they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $ 15 million , UNK many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success . united 's directors voted themselves , and their spouses , UNK access to the friendly UNK -- free first-class travel , and $ 20,000 a year for life as well . UNK , in a UNK buy-out , they could be UNK back to coach seats for life . thomas h. johnson , president of the UNK division of UNK corp. , was named president of UNK forest products corp. , a UNK unit , and senior vice president of UNK corp . mr. johnson succeeds harry w. UNK , who resigned to pursue other interests , in both positions . UNK is a building and forest products concern . us facilities corp. said robert j. UNK agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company . `` there was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company , '' a spokeswoman said . mr. UNK declined to comment . in a statement , us facilities said mr. UNK 's employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years . he will also remain a director , us facilities said , but wo n't serve on any board committees . mr. UNK will be succeeded on an interim basis by george UNK , us facilities chairman and president . in the same statement , us facilities also said it had bought back UNK of its common shares in a private transaction . terms were n't disclosed . the buy-back represents about 3 % of the company 's shares , based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of sept. 30 . in national over-the-counter trading yesterday , us facilities closed at $ UNK , unchanged . three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings , bolstered by strong sales of newer , UNK prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins . merck & co. reported a 25 % increase in earnings ; UNK co. 's profit rose 22 % and eli lilly & co. 's net income rose 24 % . the results were in line with analysts ' expectations . merck & co . merck , UNK , n.j. , continued to lead the industry with a strong sales performance in the human and UNK UNK segment . a stronger u.s. dollar reduced third-quarter and UNK sales growth 2 % and 3 % , respectively . international sales accounted for 47 % of total company sales for the nine months , compared with 50 % a year earlier . sales for the quarter rose to $ UNK billion from $ 1.47 billion . UNK , merck 's new UNK drug , had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the u.s. in the year following introduction , the company said . the drug was introduced in west germany this year . intense competition , however , led to unit sales declines for a group of merck 's established human and UNK products , including UNK and UNK . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , merck shares closed at $ UNK , up 50 cents . UNK co . UNK , morris plains , n.j. , reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the UNK quarter in a row of 20 % or more per-share earnings growth . spurred by growth in world-wide sales of the company 's prescription drugs , UNK said 1989 will be the best year in its history , with per-share earnings expected to increase more than 20 % to about $ UNK . sales for the quarter rose to $ 1.11 billion from $ 1.03 billion . UNK world-wide sales rose 9 % in the quarter to $ UNK million ; u.s. sales rose 15 % . the segment 's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs UNK , a UNK regulator , and UNK , a calcium channel blocker . world-wide sales of UNK 's non-prescription health-care products , such as UNK UNK tablets , UNK antacid , and UNK skin lotion , increased 3 % to $ UNK million in the third quarter ; u.s. sales rose 5 % . UNK products sales also had strong growth in the quarter . world-wide sales of trident gum , UNK UNK UNK , and UNK gum and UNK UNK , increased 12 % to $ UNK million . UNK shares closed at $ UNK a share , up $ 1.50 , in big board composite trading yesterday . eli lilly & co . lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals , medical instruments and UNK products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad . earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate , profit from the UNK of the debt instrument received from faberge inc. in connection with lilly 's sale of UNK UNK inc. in 1987 , and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at lilly 's UNK inc. unit . third-quarter sales of the UNK , ind. , company rose 11 % to $ UNK billion from $ UNK million . nine-month sales grew 12 % to $ UNK billion from $ 3.03 billion a year earlier . sales of UNK , an UNK , led UNK increases . higher sales of pesticides and other UNK products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of UNK products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales , lilly said . advanced cardiovascular systems inc. and UNK pacemakers inc. units led growth in the UNK systems division . lilly shares closed yesterday in composite trading on the big board at $ UNK , down 12.5 cents . reuben mark , chairman of colgate-palmolive co. , said he is `` comfortable '' with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $ 1.05 a share . that compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier ; including discontinued operations , per-share was 88 cents a year ago . the per-share estimates mean the UNK company 's net income , increased to between $ UNK million and $ 76 million , from $ UNK million the year-before period . analysts estimate colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8 % to $ 1.29 billion . mr. mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in latin america , asia and europe . results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful '' increase in operating profit by colgate 's u.s. business , mr. mark said . operating profit at colgate 's u.s. household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter , mr. mark added . he said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities . the estimated improvement in colgate 's u.s. operations took some analysts by surprise . colgate 's household products business , which includes such brands as fab laundry detergent and UNK UNK , has been a weak performer . analysts estimate colgate 's sales of household products in the u.s. were flat for the quarter , and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 % . `` if you could say their business in the u.s. was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says UNK austin , an analyst with wertheim schroder & co . `` but it 's not mediocre , it 's a real problem . '' mr. mark conceded that colgate 's domestic business , apart from its highly profitable hill 's pet products unit , has lagged . `` we 've done a lot to improve -lcb- u.s. . -rcb- results , and a lot more will be done , '' mr. mark said . `` improving profitability of u.s. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . '' to focus on its global UNK business , colgate sold its UNK health-care business in 1988 . h. anthony UNK was elected a director of this company , which primarily has interests in radio and television stations , increasing the number of seats to five . UNK also operates UNK UNK , entertainment properties and small UNK systems . mr. UNK is executive , special projects , at UNK group holdings inc. , which is controlled by manufacturers hanover corp . the boston UNK says its newly redesigned pages have a `` UNK '' look with UNK fixtures aimed at making the paper `` more consistent '' and `` easier to read . '' maybe so -- if you can find where your favorite writer went . UNK UNK , who spare no UNK when taking on local UNK such as michael `` UNK UNK '' dukakis , or new england UNK coach raymond `` UNK ray '' berry , yesterday poured UNK on new UNK of UNK UNK that replaced old photos in the UNK pages this week . by late last night , UNK managing editor thomas UNK , UNK to the will of his troops , scrapped the new UNK . for a few days at least , he says , no pictures or UNK of any kind will UNK the columns . trouble was , nobody thought they looked right . UNK columnist mike UNK -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- UNK that his UNK UNK was so bad , it looked `` like a face you 'd find on a bottle of miracle UNK that promises to do away with UNK in our UNK . '' mr. UNK reminded readers that he still has n't UNK UNK management for UNK a $ 20 expense UNK he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story . `` i thought -lcb- the drawing -rcb- a cross between someone you 'd spot UNK open his UNK coat ... or a guy who UNK he 'd been charles UNK 's UNK for the last 19 years , '' he said . mr. UNK was hardly kinder to the UNK of colleagues michael UNK -lrb- `` appears to be a UNK '' -rrb- , will UNK -lrb- `` looks as if he drove for UNK lincoln '' -rrb- or UNK english , whose `` little girl now UNK UNK every time she sees a newspaper . '' lynn UNK , the UNK 's assistant managing editor for design , acknowledges that the UNK were `` on the low end of the UNK spectrum . '' rival boston herald columnist UNK UNK , who usually rails at UNK `` UNK '' and UNK , argued that the new UNK were designed to hide mr. UNK 's `` rapidly growing UNK '' and the UNK defects of `` UNK '' dan UNK , a UNK sports columnist . `` but think of the money you , the reader , will save on halloween , '' said mr. UNK . `` instead of buying UNK for your kids , just cut out the UNK ' pictures ... . deeply UNK in both the book review `` UNK nature UNK '' by stephen macdonald -lrb- UNK & arts , sept. 27 -rrb- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global UNK is entirely a result of human activity . is such a view UNK ? in the absence of humans , would the earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term ? clearly not . about 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended . enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of north america , northern europe and asia . this global UNK must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand UNK hunting UNK and scratching around in UNK . furthermore , no bell has yet UNK to announce the end of this UNK episode of natural global UNK . it is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present-day global UNK . i bow to no one in my UNK for our UNK heritage , but if we are serious about global UNK we must look at the big picture and not allow the dominant culture to lock us into the UNK - UNK scenario as the sole model for UNK . UNK UNK UNK department university of the internal revenue service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation . in addition , the UNK agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new UNK positions to guide the UNK agency : a comptroller to UNK daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system , which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world . the irs also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer , who will be hired from within the agency . irs commissioner fred t. goldberg said the changes are intended to bring `` accountability '' to the agency , which has an annual budget of more than $ 5 billion and collects about $ 1 trillion a year . `` my assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us UNK and effectively formulate and execute our budget , '' mr. goldberg said . `` and we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ 5 billion properly . '' mr. goldberg , who took over as head of the irs in july , has been UNK by what he UNK the inefficiency , waste and lack of UNK among the branches of the vast federal agency . the irs operates on a computer system designed in 1961 , which it has been trying to modernize for years . and the agency , which operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $ UNK million budget UNK , has been under a hiring UNK since last fall . the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward UNK its ability to collect more tax revenue . `` i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget UNK and execution process which , in turn , i believe will result in a significant increase in revenue , '' he said . the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon . UNK , it would appoint career civil UNK from within the agency , but mr. goldberg said he plans to `` UNK the world '' for the chief information officer and the comptroller . although the jobs will probably pay between $ 70,000 and $ 80,000 a year , irs officials are confident that they can attract UNK candidates from the private sector . `` you 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever , '' mr. goldberg said . `` on the comptroller side , you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ 6 billion budget . when UNK UNK UNK , the leader of the UNK coup in panama , was UNK , his body UNK several UNK UNK , a UNK UNK and broken UNK and UNK . they were the signature of his UNK , panamanian leader manuel UNK noriega . the rebel officer 's slow and painful death , at the headquarters of panama 's UNK UNK , was personally supervised by gen. noriega , says a u.s. official with access to intelligence reports . leaping into UNK , sinking into UNK of UNK and UNK , mr. noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup , according to u.s. officials monitoring UNK and UNK UNK in panama city . he is now changing the place he UNK every night , sometimes more than once a night . his UNK are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time UNK , UNK UNK , and her mother , UNK . and he is collecting the names of those who UNK the UNK to UNK them during their brief time in control of his headquarters . more enemies to be UNK with . in the two weeks since the UNK , which the u.s. UNK backed , mr. noriega has been at his most UNK - and efficient - in maintaining power . yet , while the failed coup is a major u.s. foreign policy embarrassment , it is merely the latest chapter in a UNK relationship between mr. noriega and washington that UNK back three decades . america 's war on the dictator over the past two years , following his indictment on drug charges in february 1988 , is the UNK of that relationship . before american foreign policy set out to UNK noriega , it helped create him out of the UNK of panama 's long history of UNK and UNK . for most of the past 30 years , the marriage was one of convenience . in 1960 , for example , when mr. noriega was both a UNK at an elite military academy in peru and a UNK for the u.s. defense intelligence agency , he was UNK by UNK authorities for allegedly UNK and UNK UNK a UNK , according to a u.s. embassy cable from that period . the woman had nearly died . but u.s. intelligence , rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy , merely filed the report away . mr. noriega 's tips on emerging leftists at his school were UNK more important to u.s. interests . from that point on , the u.s. would make a practice of UNK the panamanian 's UNK . the u.s. has UNK and later turned against many dictators , but none quite so UNK . the UNK mr. noriega is n't as smooth as the UNK of iran , as UNK as nicaragua 's UNK UNK , as imperial as ferdinand marcos of the philippines or as UNK as haiti 's baby UNK UNK . yet he has proved more UNK than any of them . and out of necessity : the u.s. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power , but a single error on his part could cost him his life . `` the u.s. UNK noriega all along , '' says UNK moss , a former ambassador to panama . `` he has mastered the art of survival . '' in keeping with america 's long history of UNK up mr. noriega , recent u.s. actions have extended rather than UNK his survival . mr. noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of panama 's UNK economic situation , says mr. moss , but increasing UNK pressure has only given him additional UNK for UNK , and a UNK for his own UNK . `` if the u.s. had sat back and done nothing , he might not have made it through 1988 , '' mr. moss contends . perhaps most important , mr. noriega 's allies have UNK to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the UNK . one colombian drug UNK , upon hearing in 1987 that gen. noriega was negotiating with the u.s. to UNK his command for a comfortable UNK , sent him a UNK UNK UNK UNK with his name . `` he is cornered , '' says the UNK fernando UNK , who has led catholic church opposition against noriega . `` the americans have left him without a way out . it is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option . '' his chief advantage in the fight : his UNK knowledge of american ways and weaknesses . mr. noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the UNK , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation . the u.s. discovered the young tony noriega in late 1959 , when he was in his second year at the UNK military academy in UNK , according to former u.s. intelligence officials . the contact occurred through mr. noriega 's UNK , a panamanian diplomat based in peru named UNK carlos noriega UNK . UNK carlos , knowing that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer , UNK tony 's reports on the leftist UNK he observed among his fellow students and , more important , among his officers and instructors . a spy was born . it was a heady experience for the UNK and slightly built mr. noriega , who was known to his friends as UNK la UNK -- pineapple face . born the illegitimate son of his father 's UNK , he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city . tony was four years older than most of his fellow UNK , and gained admission to the academy because his brother had UNK his birth certificate . he considered himself UNK superior to his peruvian peers , many of whom were UNK sons sent by their UNK families to the highly UNK , UNK academy as a sort of reform school . in his peaked military cap and UNK pressed , UNK uniform , noriega felt more UNK and powerful than ever in his UNK life , friends from the period say . `` he had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a UNK of UNK , where officers were the elite with special UNK , '' recalls UNK UNK , a fellow student in peru and a lifelong friend . mr. noriega 's relationship to american intelligence agencies became UNK in either 1966 or UNK , intelligence officials say . his commanding officer at the UNK province garrison , major UNK UNK , gave him an intriguing UNK : mr. noriega would UNK the province 's first intelligence service . the spy network would serve two clients : the panamanian government , by monitoring political opponents in the region , and the u.s. , by tracking the growing communist influence in the unions organized at united fruit co. 's banana UNK in UNK del UNK and puerto UNK . united fruit was one of the two largest UNK to panama 's national income . satisfying its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader . mr. noriega 's initial UNK was only $ 50 to $ 100 a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or UNK from the american UNK , a former intelligence official says . it was modest pay by american standards , but a healthy boost to his small military salary , which fellow officers remember as having been $ 300 to $ 400 monthly . `` he did it very well , '' recalls boris martinez , a former panamanian UNK who managed mr. noriega and his operation . `` he started building the UNK that helped him gain power . '' a national guard job assumed by UNK noriega in UNK -- as chief of the transit police in david city , capital of the UNK province -- was tailor-made for an UNK UNK . by pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses , he gained a ready UNK of information . he knew which local UNK had been caught driving drunk , which had been found with their UNK . this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in UNK , when union leaders were planning a may day march that the government feared could turn violent . mr. noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy . so he UNK the information on UNK that he distributed throughout the UNK city of puerto UNK , which was ruled by united fruit co . the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control . `` it was like a play on UNK , '' recalls mr. martinez . `` noriega managed the whole thing . he was UNK . noriega was an expert at UNK and UNK people . '' during his years in UNK , however , mr. noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious . UNK UNK , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an UNK noriega visiting UNK in their cells at the UNK UNK garrison headquarters in david , where he had his offices . mr. noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office . `` people started wondering if something was wrong with him , '' mr. UNK recalls . but through this period , so far as the u.s. military was concerned , mr. noriega was a model UNK . he signed up for intelligence and UNK training under american officers at fort UNK in panama in july UNK , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details mr. noriega has since classified as secret . he flew to fort UNK , n.c. , in september of that year for a course in psychological operations , returning to the school of the americas in panama for a UNK course called `` military intelligence for officers . '' some american officers interpreted his eagerness and UNK as a sign of loyalty , but they did so falsely . he rose to chief of intelligence in panama 's socalled UNK in 1970 after providing UNK dictator UNK the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier . he became gen. UNK 's UNK shadow , and the holder of all panama 's secrets . mr. noriega , by now a lieutenant UNK , expanded his UNK to include the UNK -- not to mention the UNK , the UNK and any other intelligence service that came knocking . when u.s. diplomats complained to the cia of UNK noriega 's UNK , intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the americans . `` early on in the state department , we took to calling him the UNK , in UNK to his ability to simultaneously UNK the UNK intelligence services of cuba and the united states , '' recalls francis j. mcneil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for UNK affairs , first ran across reports about mr. noriega in 1977 . `` some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the UNK . '' even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns . during the nixon administration , the drug enforcement administration became UNK at the extent of the UNK 's connections to arrested drug traffickers . one UNK agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with UNK noriega , one of which was assassination . the head of the UNK at the time , john UNK , UNK the assassination plan . but he did fly to panama to UNK dictator UNK on the drug ties of panamanian officials , including mr. noriega . mr. UNK later recalled that gen. UNK seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s. . `` everybody was afraid of him , '' mr. UNK says . mr. noriega became an even greater threat in 1976 , when u.s. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying UNK of electronically UNK conversations from three UNK working for the u.s. army 's UNK military intelligence group . the tapes included UNK of gen. UNK 's own phone , according to american intelligence officials . `` we caught him with his hands on our UNK UNK , '' says former cia director UNK turner . for the first time , the u.s. considered cutting mr. noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , mr. turner says . `` in the world of intelligence , if you want to get information , you get it from UNK UNK . the question is how much you get tied in with UNK UNK so they can UNK you . '' intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr. noriega sold sensitive information on the UNK to the UNK or others . mr. turner was troubled enough to cancel the u.s. contract with the UNK at the beginning of the carter administration . the u.s. soon found new cause for concern : UNK . prosecutors in southern florida indicted five UNK on charges of illegally running arms to sandinista rebels trying to UNK the nicaraguan government of mr. UNK . they included one of mr. noriega 's UNK friends and business partners , carlos UNK . and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr. noriega himself . at the time , though , in 1979 , the u.s. was once again UNK with its longtime latin american spy . mr. noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon . UNK county and federal authorities , learning that he intended to fly through miami , made plans to arrest him on the UNK charges as soon as he hit u.s. soil . it was a friday in june . the pentagon foiled the plan . according to military officers at the time , word was passed to mr. noriega by his american UNK that the police would be waiting . on monday , u.s. officials received a routine , UNK message from the military group commander in panama . `` due to health reasons , UNK UNK noriega has elected to postpone his visit to washington , '' it read . prosecutors in miami received yet another setback . their original indictment against mr. UNK , the friend of mr. noriega , and the other four was dismissed on a UNK . but now , along with UNK mr. noriega 's UNK , they intended to charge mr. noriega himself , on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million in arms . in january 1980 , jerome sanford , as assistant u.s. attorney , was UNK to a meeting with a federal bureau of investigation agent assigned to the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and UNK in miami . panamanian dictator UNK , he was told , had granted the UNK of iran UNK in panama as a favor to washington . mr. sanford was told mr. noriega 's friend , mr. UNK , would be handling the UNK 's security . it would n't be a good idea to UNK him -- much less mr. noriega , the prosecutor was told . after prodding from mr. sanford , u.s. attorney jack UNK pleaded with justice department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed . `` unfortunately , '' mr. UNK wrote in a letter , `` those of us in law enforcement in miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the united states but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control . '' the letter , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the UNK of justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death . `` i think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now , '' mr. sanford says . `` if he had been found guilty , we could have stopped him . '' in august 1983 , mr. noriega took over as general and UNK dictator of panama , having UNK his way to the top only two years after the UNK death in a plane crash of his old UNK UNK UNK . soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses . the reagan administration also put mr. noriega 's UNK back on the u.s. payroll . payments averaged nearly $ 200,000 a year from the u.s. defense intelligence agency and the cia . although working for u.s. intelligence , mr. noriega was hardly helping the u.s. exclusively . during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence UNK with the UNK and the sandinistas . he allegedly entered into panama 's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses , according to UNK UNK , a pilot who once worked for mr. noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand jury in miami that would ultimately UNK the panamanian on drug charges . but mr. noriega was convinced the reagan white house would n't act against him , recalls his close UNK jose UNK , because he had an insurance policy : his involvement with the contra rebels in nicaragua . mr. UNK says the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in panama . mr. noriega also UNK intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaraguan capital of managua . and on at least one occasion , in the spring of 1985 , he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a sandinista UNK in nicaragua . although , his help for the contra cause was limited , it was enough to win him important UNK in the reagan administration , says sen. patrick UNK , a UNK democrat who then served on the senate intelligence committee . `` noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a UNK , '' he says . an incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which mr. noriega might have maintained such influence with washington -- by UNK u.s. officials . UNK UNK , then the ambassador to costa rica , recalls being invited to panama by mr. noriega 's brother UNK carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the UNK UNK . mr. UNK notified UNK e. UNK , the u.s. ambassador to panama , of the UNK . `` UNK screamed , '' mr. UNK recalls . he says mr. UNK told him he was being set up for a `` UNK UNK , '' in which mr. noriega would try to involve him in an UNK and then record the event `` with sound and video . '' mr. UNK , on vacation after resigning his position at the national security council , could n't be reached for comment . as mr. noriega 's political troubles grew , so did his offers of assistance to the contras , an apparent attempt to UNK more favor in washington . for instance , he helped steal the may 1984 panamanian elections for the ruling party . but just one month later , he also contributed $ 100,000 to a contra leader , according to documents released for oliver north 's criminal trial in washington , d.c . yet , his political setbacks UNK . mr. noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the UNK of hugo UNK , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly UNK mr. noriega on drug trafficking charges . he then ousted president UNK UNK UNK , a former world bank official with close ties to the u.s. , after mr. UNK tried to create a commission to investigate the murder . and , all the while , panama 's debt problems continued to grow . mr. noriega was growing desperate . in late 1986 , he made an offer he thought the u.s. could n't refuse . as recounted in a UNK that UNK government documents released for the north trial , mr. noriega offered to UNK the sandinista leadership in exchange `` for a promise to help clean up noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the -lcb- u.s. . -rcb- ban on military sales to the panamanian defense forces . '' `` north , '' the document went on , referring to oliver north , `` has told noriega 's UNK that u.s. law forbade such actions . the UNK responded that noriega had numerous assets in place in nicaragua and could UNK many essential things , just as noriega had helped -lcb- the u.s. . -rcb- the previous year in UNK up a sandinista UNK . '' UNK north UNK the request to his UNK and to assistant secretary of state UNK UNK , who UNK it to secretary of state george UNK . mr. noriega 's proposal was turned down . and mr. UNK UNK told mr. UNK that the general should be told that only he could repair his tarnished image . the end of the marriage was at hand . within weeks the UNK iran-contra scandal took away mr. noriega 's insurance policy . the death of cia director william casey and resignation of oliver north allowed UNK political forces to gain influence . public UNK against him were triggered in june 1987 due to charges by UNK UNK , his former chief of staff , that mr. noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of messrs. UNK and UNK . few american officials were willing any longer to defend him . lawyers in miami -- this time working virtually without UNK -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in february 1988 . during negotiations with american officials in may 1988 over proposals to drop the u.s. UNK in exchange for his resignation , mr. noriega often asked almost UNK how the americans , whom he had helped for so many years , could turn against him . now , neither side -- the u.s. nor mr. noriega -- has an easy out . president bush has sworn to bring him to justice . mr. noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue UNK to power . it is a UNK battle -- perhaps to the death . in the end , is mr. noriega the political equivalent of UNK 's UNK , created by a UNK but UNK foreign power ? not quite , sen. UNK contends . `` for short-term gains , people were willing to put up with him . that allowed him to get stronger and stronger , '' he says . `` i do n't think we created him as much as we fed him , UNK him and let him grow up to be big and strong . upjohn co. reported that third-quarter net income rose to $ 96 million , or 52 cents a share , from $ UNK million , or 49 cents a share , a year earlier . yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available . industrial production declined 0.1 % in september , reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend . the federal reserve board said output of the nation 's factories , mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 % in the third quarter , substantially slower than the 3.3 % annual rate in the second quarter . `` capital spending and exports , which have been the driving force in this expansion , are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them , '' said robert UNK , economist for northern trust co. in chicago . the new reports of sluggishness , which were UNK by an earlier labor department report that manufacturing UNK dropped by UNK in september , give the fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates . `` they need to do something about this , '' said maury harris , economist at painewebber group inc . the fed also said u.s. industry operated at UNK % of capacity last month , down from UNK % in august . measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures . factory output dropped 0.2 % , its first decline since february , after having been unchanged in october . factories operated at 83.7 % of capacity , the lowest rate in more than a year and down from UNK % in september . the declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods , those intended to last more than three years . the biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers , a category that includes the steel industry . output of business equipment was unchanged in september . production of factory equipment , one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending , fell 0.3 % . some economists expect further declines in investment spending . `` whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to UNK subsequently , '' mr. harris said . `` you have n't seen the full effect of that yet . '' a decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto UNK , the fed noted . analysts do n't expect the september surge in auto production to be repeated in the coming months . here is a summary of the federal reserve board 's report on industrial production in september . the figures are seasonally adjusted . UNK % of the 1977 average . robin UNK , president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company , was elected to the additional posts of chairman , president and chief executive of the company 's new england savings bank subsidiary . william r. UNK resigned those posts , as well as a seat on UNK 's board . UNK is also the parent of UNK . UNK mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline , federal researchers report . the drop is particularly large for white UNK , although black UNK and white and black women also show lower mortality rates . a report in this week 's issue of the journal of the national cancer institute also projects that overall u.s. mortality rates from lung cancer , the leading cause of cancer death , should begin to drop in several years if cigarette UNK continues to UNK . the report , which comes 25 years after the u.s. surgeon general issued a report warning against the UNK of UNK , is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in UNK is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer . `` what this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact , '' said UNK UNK , an UNK at the johns hopkins school of UNK and public health in baltimore . the national cancer institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the UNK of 35 and 44 a decade apart . the death rate from lung cancer of white UNK aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000 , but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6 , a decline of UNK % . measured the same way , the decline for black UNK was 14.2 % . the drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9 % for blacks and 5.3 % for whites . the study , by susan UNK , william UNK and joseph UNK of the institute 's staff , also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the UNK age UNK , except black men . although UNK mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole , the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women . UNK mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55 , with sharp increases for everybody but white men . but dr. UNK , one of the authors of the report , said `` the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a UNK of declining mortality in the future . '' however , he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in UNK . `` even though these favorable trends in UNK mortality affect all sex and race groups , they ca n't be taken for granted , '' the report says . `` UNK prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population , especially children , UNK and minorities . '' an editorial in the UNK journal says the report of declining UNK mortality `` among young men and women in the u.s. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ 2 billion a year for promotion of the UNK habit of UNK . '' but the editorial , by UNK UNK of the world health organization , notes that tobacco consumption and UNK mortality rates are rising in developing countries . `` UNK should be established as the norm of social behavior '' around the world , the editorial says , through the UNK of laws that limit advertising , boost tobacco prices and promote UNK education . asked for comment , walker UNK , a vice president of the tobacco institute , said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the u.s. could violate the first amendment protection of free speech . according to the american cancer society , UNK is responsible for 85 % of the UNK cases among men and 75 % among women . the UNK report UNK the differences in mortality rates by race to different UNK patterns . a higher proportion of black men smoke than white men . while nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke , in both UNK more whites have given up UNK than blacks . in UNK changes in mortality rates over the past decade , the UNK study looked only at blacks and whites . UNK and UNK americans were n't studied ; hispanics were included with whites . recent changes in average annual UNK UNK rates per 100,000 population by race and sex . white UNK white UNK black UNK black UNK directors elected r. marvin UNK , currently vice UNK supply , purchasing , to head the company 's washington , d.c. , office . as vice UNK relations , mr.

'' mr. UNK said the market is still settling down after the recent correction . most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit , he and other traders said . `` everybody 's UNK and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds , '' said mr. UNK . `` a lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth . they 're just as UNK .

'' shortly thereafter , UNK articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial UNK would produce a blackened , UNK planet possibly by the turn of the century . these UNK UNK were advanced by such UNK as paul UNK , barry UNK , UNK UNK and george UNK . writing in the 1960s ms. UNK suggested that the human race could be eliminated in 20 years , and mr. UNK suggested that life on earth might end by 1985 . mr.

'' first and UNK , the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment . consider , for example , the UNK effect and climate change ; numerous UNK scientific committees , including one from the national academy of science , judge there is a greater than 50 % probability of a grave problem in the offing . the point was to answer the question in the conference title , not to try to create news stories for the event itself . nor was it intended to UNK a set of UNK solutions , although various points were raised . each speaker was asked to address a specific topic , not deliver a point of view . each scientist UNK concluded society and government are UNK when it comes to UNK policy change . this leads to a very special sense of UNK . if the media decide to work harder at UNK the public about these complex and technical issues , that hardly can be UNK UNK UNK . the environment can no longer be a normal issue , to be UNK with on a UNK basis with comfortable increments of change . we have literally altered the chemistry and UNK of our planet 's atmosphere . this UNK consequences from what we have already done that will be very UNK to social and economic systems . the problems of the environment are so UNK , so UNK UNK with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years . the consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence to advise major policy changes . no , we are not UNK . thomas e. UNK assistant secretary for UNK affairs UNK institution coca-cola enterprises inc. , UNK its dismal earnings forecast for 1989 , said its third-quarter net income fell 68 % on flat revenue . stung by higher marketing costs and slowing volume growth , the giant coke UNK operation said net fell to $ 12.7 million , or six cents a share , from $ UNK million , or 26 cents a share , the year earlier . the results met estimates of analysts , who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late august that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37 % . a company spokesman said yesterday that coca-cola enterprises sticks by its 1989 forecast . third-quarter revenue was flat at $ 1.02 billion . the year-ago results , however , included the operations of a UNK business , which was sold last december . excluding that UNK business , coca-cola enterprises ' volume , measured by cases of UNK , rose only 1 % . the volume is well below the industry 's 4 % to 5 % growth rate of recent years , but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter . the latest third-quarter volume also compares with a very strong 10 % growth in the year-ago quarter . coca-cola enterprises blamed the lower volume on its soft-drink prices , which were about 3 % higher in the third quarter . consumers have been accustomed to buying UNK at discounted prices for several years . coca-cola enterprises said it had to boost spending for trade and dealer incentives to try to keep volumes from slipping . the company said it expects consumers will adjust to higher-priced soft drinks . a spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14 % increase in selling , administrative and general expenses -- to $ UNK million -- to marketing costs . `` they 're out there promoting like crazy , trying to get prices up by promotion , '' said roy UNK , an analyst with kidder , peabody & co . for the nine months , coca-cola enterprises ' net fell 31 % to $ 65 million , or 39 cents a share , from $ UNK million , or 63 cents a share . revenue was flat at about $ UNK billion . coca-cola enterprises , which is UNK by coca-cola co. , also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter . the buy-back is part of a UNK repurchase plan , under which coca-cola enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares . separately , purchase , UNK pepsico inc. , as expected , said fiscal third-quarter net rose 11 % to $ UNK million , or $ 1.02 a share , from $ UNK million , or 91 cents a share . sales rose 25 % to $ UNK billion from $ 3.13 billion . the year-ago quarter 's results include an after-tax charge of $ 5.9 million from the sale of a UNK in spain . in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , coca-cola enterprises closed at $ UNK a share , down 62.5 cents . pepsico closed at $ UNK a share , up $ 1.375 . l.j. hooker corp. is expected to reach an agreement in principle this week to sell UNK UNK inc. to management , say executives familiar with the talks . l.j. hooker , based in atlanta , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year . currently , its parent company , hooker corp. of sydney , australia , is being managed by a court-appointed UNK . it is expected that ge capital corp. , a financial-services subsidiary of general electric co. , will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of UNK , based in sacramento , calif . a spokesman for ge capital declined to comment . ge capital has a working relationship with l.j. hooker . it is providing $ 50 million in emergency financing to the company and has agreed to buy as much as $ 75 million in receivables from b. altman & co. and bonwit teller , l.j. hooker 's two fully owned department-store chains . sam UNK , chief executive officer of the nationwide UNK chain , and sanford UNK , chief executive of l.j. hooker corp. , both declined to comment . currently , mr. UNK owns 20 % of the company ; l.j. hooker acquired its 80 % interest in the firm in may 1986 . at the time , the UNK chain had 11 stores in operation . today , there are 77 units , all located in shopping UNK . in recent weeks mr. UNK has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out , say those familiar with the situation . this year , a number of retail leveraged UNK have failed , causing jitters among suppliers , and mr. UNK apparently wanted assurances that he wo n't have delivery problems . for the year ended june 30 , 1989 , UNK UNK had $ 62 million of revenue and operating profit of $ 2.5 million . the UNK chain was put up for sale in june . according to those familiar with the situation , other bidders included UNK group plc of london and kay UNK inc . first boston corp. is advising l.j. hooker on the sale of the UNK business . UNK was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by l.j. hooker . the company was founded in sacramento in 1929 by two brothers , ralph and walter UNK , who operated as UNK 's UNK . in 1979 , the pair split the company in half , with walter and his son , sam , agreeing to operate under the UNK UNK name . the sale of UNK UNK is subject to approval by judge UNK UNK of u.s. bankruptcy court . as earlier reported , l.j. hooker this week received a $ 409 million bid for its three shopping UNK , plus other properties from a consortium led by UNK real-estate investor jay UNK and a. UNK simpson , an atlanta developer and former l.j. hooker senior executive . the offer , which did n't include the UNK chain , is being reviewed by mr. UNK . robert j.

UNK , vice president of finance and administration for national broadcasting co. , a unit of general electric co . mr. UNK said that nbc entertainment president UNK UNK , who declined to be interviewed , is `` looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by UNK . '' he declined to elaborate . nbc 's options could range from UNK programming to sports shows , although the network declined to comment . one major nbc affiliate , UNK in sacramento , plans to cancel the nbc saturday morning UNK as of january and replace it with a local UNK . the one-hour program will be repeated with updates throughout saturday UNK . `` we feel there is an opportunity for an audience that is not being served by any network , so we want to take the lead , '' says UNK 's general manager , john UNK . `` we do n't need UNK anymore . they only accounted for 5 % , at best , of the station 's total revenues . '' an nbc spokesman says the network will `` closely monitor '' the sacramento situation , and says it is the only station to UNK . spokesmen for the television networks of cbs inc. and capital UNK inc. , say there are no plans to alter the children 's UNK on saturday UNK . the youthful audience for saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks . there has been a surge in syndicated children 's shows to independent stations , as well as competition from UNK for kids and from cable outlets such as UNK and the disney channel . at the same time , there appears to be a market for UNK programming ; turner broadcasting system inc. 's cable news network has its highest ratings , outside of prime time , on saturday UNK . nbc has on previous occasions considered replacing UNK with a saturday version of `` today , '' which is produced by nbc news . the network 's own production company , nbc UNK , supplies a half-hour UNK show titled `` saved by the bell . '' nbc UNK or nbc news could supply the network with other saturday morning shows , a move that would control costs . UNK shows , which are made by outside production companies , cost the network about $ 300,000 per episode . UNK & UNK co. said third-quarter net income UNK 35 % to $ 32.6 million , or 49 cents a share . in the year-earlier quarter , the chemicals company had net of $ UNK million , or 75 cents a share . sales were $ UNK million , up 0.5 % from $ UNK million a year ago . UNK & UNK , which plans to start operating seven new production units this year , attributed the profit slide partly to higher start-up expense . the company also cited the stronger dollar , which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars . in addition , the company said , it was hurt by higher than UNK costs for raw materials , though those costs have declined since the second quarter . UNK higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs , such as overtime pay . for the nine months , UNK & UNK net totaled $ UNK million , or $ 2.33 a share , down 17 % from $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , a year ago . sales rose 5.2 % to $ 2.04 billion from $ UNK billion the previous year . in new york stock exchange composite trading , UNK & UNK closed at $ 33 a share , down $ 1.75 . michael a.

'' in this article , i was alleged to have said , `` any patient with high-risk UNK cancer is really getting short UNK if he 's not getting this therapy . '' i did n't say this , and i 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the UNK . i have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs , UNK and UNK , to any of my UNK patients . with this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk UNK cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer . this is not nearly good enough . i believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients , both today and tomorrow , should offer the hope of something better than that . my statement , read UNK from a printed text available to all reporters attending the national cancer institute news conference , was the following : `` new UNK UNK are already in operation seeking to improve these results . these research UNK offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better . i feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short UNK if he is not offered this opportunity .

UNK UNK . UNK clinic rochester , UNK . the oil and auto industries , united in their dislike of president bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels , announced a joint research program that could turn up a UNK gasoline . officials of the big three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most UNK fuel for reducing cities ' UNK problems , with no bias toward any fuel in particular . however , their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure UNK -- the two UNK alternative fuels -- in tests to be completed by next summer . instead , the tests will focus heavily on new UNK of gasoline , which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is UNK urban areas . environmentalists criticized the program as merely a UNK attempt to head off a white house proposal to require a million cars a year that run on UNK fuels by 1997 . while major oil companies have been experimenting with UNK gasoline UNK for years , only atlantic richfield co. is now marketing a UNK gasoline for older cars currently running on UNK fuel . the initial $ 11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of UNK gasolines , said joe UNK , head of fuels and UNK at general motors corp. research laboratories . it will compare 21 different UNK of gasolines with three UNK of up to 85 % UNK . a second phase of research , which is still being planned , will test UNK gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars . there was no cost estimate for the second phase . `` the whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers , '' said keith UNK , a senior vice president of technology at amoco corp . `` and we are looking for the most UNK way to clean up the air . '' but david UNK , an environmental lawyer with the natural resources defense council , said the research appears merely to be a way to promote UNK gasoline . oil and auto companies supported a move on capitol hill last week to gut mr. bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling UNK cars by 1995 . instead , a house subcommittee adopted a UNK program that specifically UNK UNK gasoline as an alternative . the bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the house energy and commerce committee takes up a comprehensive UNK bill . william seidman , chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp. , said lincoln savings & loan association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion . mr. seidman , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , UNK the problems of lincoln , based in irvine , calif. , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law . he made his comments before house banking committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a UNK industry . the inquiry also will cover the actions of charles UNK jr. , who is chairman of american continental corp. , lincoln 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several u.s. senators . mr. seidman told the committee that the resolution trust corp. , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 . `` my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate UNK order to stop the hazardous operations , '' mr. seidman said . when lincoln was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of american continental 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to mr. seidman . but the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after american continental filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors . the bankruptcy filing , the government has charged in a $ 1.1 billion civil lawsuit , was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company , which used the deposits as a UNK for real-estate deals . the deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the UNK of the bankruptcy court . `` i think it 's fairly clear -lcb- mr. UNK -rcb- knew , '' that regulators were set to UNK lincoln , mr. seidman said . further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against lincoln 's executives , said mr. seidman , `` including fraud actions . '' mr. UNK , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators UNK seized the thrift . UNK UNK , an attorney in washington for mr. UNK , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , `` we will be responding UNK in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . '' lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency UNK by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from mr. UNK . mr. seidman said yesterday , for example , that sen. dennis UNK -lrb- d. , ariz. -rrb- , who received $ UNK in contributions from mr. UNK , phoned mr. seidman to request that he push for a sale of lincoln before it would be seized . after the government lawsuit was filed against lincoln , sen. UNK returned the campaign contributions . the senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of lincoln because `` hundreds of arizona jobs -lcb- at lincoln -rcb- were on the line . '' senate banking committee chairman donald UNK -lrb- d. , UNK . -rrb- has also returned contributions he received from mr. UNK a year ago . sens. john glenn -lrb- d. , ohio -rrb- , john UNK , -lrb- r. , ariz. -rrb- and alan UNK -lrb- d. , calif. -rrb- also received substantial contributions from mr. UNK and sought to intervene on behalf of lincoln . house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez -lrb- d. , texas -rrb- said sen. UNK UNK to appear before the house committee , if necessary . but a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators . at the hearing , mr. seidman said the rtc has already pumped $ 729 million into lincoln for liquidity . he also held out little hope of UNK for purchasers of $ 225 million in american continental subordinated debt . some of those debtholders have filed a suit , saying they believed they were buying UNK certificates of deposit . `` we have no plans at this time to pay off those notes , '' he said . eastern airlines ' creditors committee , UNK with the carrier 's plans for emerging from UNK proceedings , asked its own experts to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization . representatives of the accounting firm of ernst & young and the securities firm of goldman , sachs & co. , hired by creditors to consult on eastern 's financial plans , told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that eastern 's latest plan to emerge from UNK protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval . according to one person present at the meeting , eastern 's new plan is financially `` overly optimistic . '' asked about the consultants ' reports , an eastern spokeswoman said `` we totally disagree . '' she said they have `` UNK and made some erroneous assumptions that make their analysis completely UNK . '' at a later news conference here , frank UNK , chairman of eastern 's parent texas air corp. , said eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year , operating with more service than it originally had scheduled . he insisted , as he has before , that creditors would be paid in full under the plan . mr. UNK made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan . `` we 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly , '' mr. UNK told reporters . `` we 're meeting and UNK our goals , '' he added . in july , eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for eastern to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from UNK protection at two-thirds its former size . but after selling off pieces such as its east coast shuttle , its philadelphia UNK and various planes , eastern hit a stumbling block . it could n't sell its south american routes , one of the major assets marked for disposal . those routes , valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ 400 million , were to be sold to amr corp. 's american airlines . a last-minute UNK in negotiations with amr , over an unrelated lawsuit between american and another texas air unit , caused the deal to collapse . eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself , which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization . it also would leave eastern a bigger carrier than the UNK one proposed under the initial plan . those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be UNK . since then , eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions , but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions . the committee has two groups of experts it calls on to UNK eastern 's plans . both said the new plan would n't work . ernst & young said eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest , tax and depreciation by $ 100 million , and that eastern 's plan presented no comfort level , according to a source present at yesterday 's session . experts from goldman sachs estimated eastern would miss the same mark by $ 120 million to $ UNK million , the source said . the experts said they expected eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs , and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated . other costs also would increase , including maintenance , because eastern has an older fleet . at the news conference , mr. UNK and eastern president phil UNK presented a far rosier assessment . UNK by flight attendants , pilots and gate agents UNK in UNK new blue UNK , they said eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats . starting next month , eastern will begin flying UNK flights daily instead of the previously announced 700 , they said . mr. UNK declined to give out eastern 's daily losses , but said he did n't expect eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in UNK . these accounts hold several hundred million dollars , primarily from asset sales . the plan eastern hopes to pursue , he said , calls for eastern to have $ 390 million in cash by year 's end . both he and mr. UNK predicted that plan might be confirmed in january . as to negotiations with creditors , mr. UNK said in remarks after the conference `` we 'll have to see how they -lcb- talks -rcb- come along . '' however , he added , `` it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors . it must be accepted by the court . '' under bankruptcy law , eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan . that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again . if eastern can get creditor support , court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift . but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan , or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own . in any event , some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr. UNK and mr. UNK . eastern sought UNK protection a few days after a UNK strike began march 4 . mr. UNK told reporters the reorganization eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85 % to 90 % of the size of the UNK eastern . he projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring , only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of UNK a day . hopes of UNK the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening . the method of UNK the 20 % tax , paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way , is due for a change in 1990 , thanks to 1986 's tax act . but most experts agree that the concept that is to be introduced UNK in great complexity ; they have been trying to head it off this year . ways and means chairman rostenkowski backed a UNK plan in the pending house tax bill , but the plan turns out to be a big revenue loser . now the senate 's UNK bill UNK any proposal to deal with the corporate tax . proponents of UNK fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are UNK . `` we hear it has low priority on the house side , '' says samuel UNK of coopers & lybrand , UNK . if the law is n't changed , he says , `` we are left UNK at rules that are almost impossible to UNK , because there are so many complex depreciation calculations to do . '' but congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next , UNK adds . hugo 's UNK may be offset by immediate claims for tax refunds . this law aids UNK locales named by the president as disaster areas , as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters . it UNK victims elect to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns , whichever offers the larger tax benefit ; they have until april 16 to choose . UNK a 1988 return to claim a refund UNK cash faster ; but for personal losses , there are other factors to consider , notes publisher UNK hall . a loss -- after insurance UNK -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $ 100 and that the year 's total losses exceed 10 % of adjusted gross income ; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher . in filing an original -lrb- not amended -rrb- return , a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income ; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately . the irs delays several deadlines for hugo 's victims . returns for 1988 from people with six-month filing UNK were due monday , but the irs says people in the disaster areas wo n't be UNK for late filing if their returns are marked `` hugo '' and UNK by jan. 16 . interest will be imposed on UNK taxes , but UNK penalties on the returns will be UNK if the balance due and paid is 10 % or less of the liability . irs notice UNK describes this and other deadline relief for hugo 's victims . among the provisions : UNK taxpayers with returns due last monday wo n't be UNK if they file -- or request an extension -- and pay tax due by nov. 15 . UNK returns due by oct. 31 or nov. 30 may be delayed to jan. 16 . UNK ca n't be granted for filing UNK returns due oct. 31 or for UNK withheld taxes , but late penalties will be abated for deposits made by nov. 15 . the notice also grants relief for certain UNK returns . one-day UNK in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of american business service corp. , a costa mesa , calif. , supplier of temporary workers . the irs denied cost deductions because few of the UNK got to go aboard . but the tax court said the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions . used-car buyers who try to avoid sales tax by UNK prices paid in private deals are the targets of a new york drive . estimating that the state may lose $ 15 million a year , officials announced the filing of 15 criminal actions and `` hundreds '' of civil penalties . when an ira owner UNK , the trustee of the individual retirement account must file forms UNK reporting market values relating to the UNK and each UNK , with copies to the UNK and beneficiaries . irs revenue procedure UNK describes the reporting requirements . bigger than a UNK was this cash UNK 's reputation for honesty . people often cite UNK and UNK of banks to justify cash UNK to the irs . gregory UNK brown of fremont , calif. , a UNK , UNK young UNK , told that story to the tax court . but UNK usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income ; and the irs said brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he UNK $ UNK in a bank account in UNK while reporting income of only $ UNK . brown 's story : the deposits came from savings kept in a UNK UNK ; he saved $ UNK in UNK by living with family members and UNK pennies and $ UNK of secret gifts from his UNK father , who had abandoned the family in UNK . brown had no proof ; but UNK of his mother and UNK about his father and of an UNK about his honesty and UNK satisfied a judge that brown was UNK and his tale of gifts was possible . the irs offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income , so judge UNK rejected its claims . briefs : asked how he made charitable gifts of $ UNK out of reported two-year income of $ UNK , thomas h. UNK of bryan , texas , told the tax court he had UNK his income . the court rejected his incredible claims , denied his deductions , and imposed a negligence penalty ... . rep. schaefer -lrb- r. , colo. -rrb- entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals . kay peterson UNK her bicycle and UNK up yet another steep , rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain UNK . after a UNK climb , she is UNK by a UNK vista : a UNK of golden UNK under an UNK UNK sky . this place is 12 miles into the back country -- a UNK UNK for a UNK , but reached by ms. peterson and six others in a UNK two hours of UNK UNK mountain UNK . `` this , '' says ms. peterson , `` is what it 's all about . '' UNK hundred miles away , UNK at a napa county , calif. , state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm . this summer , speeding UNK were blamed for an accident in the napa county park , in which a horse -- spooked on a trail that was closed to UNK -- broke its UNK . the UNK had to be destroyed ; the UNK fled and were never found . in numerous parks near san francisco , UNK have been forced to close UNK , set up speed UNK and use UNK UNK to curb fast and reckless riding . they have even sent UNK in pursuit of UNK after UNK and UNK complained they were being driven from UNK . `` we were being UNK , '' says steve UNK , UNK coordinator of the east bay regional park district . two years ago , the district decided to limit the UNK to fire roads in its UNK UNK acres . from about 200,000 six years ago , the number of mountain UNK in the u.s. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990 . at least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone . the controversy kicked up by the UNK of these UNK bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national UNK movement in recent memory . UNK -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- UNK their sport an efficient , safe , UNK way to get back to nature , while UNK a right , as taxpayers , to UNK on public UNK . but the UNK ' UNK numbers , safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile UNK have prompted pleas , from the UNK to the eastern UNK , to ban them from the back country . key to the issue is that the UNK , in UNK hands , can go virtually anywhere , and in reckless hands can become vehicles of UNK . an UNK UNK can leap from a dead stop to the top of a UNK table without losing balance . such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at UNK of up to 40 miles an hour -- a UNK for the UNK but a UNK for UNK UNK or UNK . for UNK UNK managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates . the state of california , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all UNK paths in state parks to mountain bicycles . the move largely UNK them to roads used by UNK vehicles . most other states have enacted similar bans . the UNK are unwelcome on UNK in national parks . even the u.s. forest service , whose UNK `` UNK '' philosophy permits UNK vehicles on thousands of miles of its UNK across the u.s. , has begun to close some UNK to the UNK , including major portions of the popular pacific crest trail , which UNK from california to canada . often these closings come after vigorous UNK lobbying by UNK organizations , the politically potent sierra club among them . sierra has been UNK in UNK a number of the california bans . it has been waging an UNK campaign to beat back a proposal , pushed by utah UNK groups , to allow the cycles in federally designated UNK areas , where they are now prohibited . yet sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization , which estimates that 17 % of its 500,000 members own mountain UNK . pressure from these members prompted the club recently to UNK its UNK UNK ; it no longer , for example , UNK the UNK into the same category as UNK and other UNK UNK vehicles . but the club still insists that public UNK ought to be closed to the UNK unless studies indicate the UNK wo n't UNK the environment or other users . `` i have a mountain UNK , yet as a UNK i 've been run off the road by kids UNK down a fire trail on them , '' says UNK UNK , an official at sierra 's headquarters in san francisco , echoing the concerns of many members . `` people who feel that UNK should be banned from an area are n't looking at the whole picture , '' complains mark UNK , associate editor of mountain and city UNK magazine in UNK park , calif . mr. UNK is among the UNK of UNK who got their first taste of UNK as UNK or UNK . he says fellow UNK show the same concern for the land that they UNK as UNK ; many are appalled that the UNK community would suddenly consider them the enemy . to fight back , activists such as mr. UNK are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the UNK can UNK share UNK . mr. UNK 's group , concerned UNK UNK association , UNK UNK drives to help keep open certain santa UNK mountain UNK designated for closing . UNK groups in montana , idaho , michigan and massachusetts have won similar concessions , says tim UNK , mountain UNK editor of UNK magazine . these groups have been trying to improve the mountain UNK 's image ; in the san UNK park district where a UNK was UNK by a UNK this summer UNK have formed a UNK UNK to help UNK enforce regulations , and to school riders in proper trail UNK . even UNK UNK sierra members concede that 10 % of all riders cause most of the problems . while some are UNK riders who simply UNK regulations , much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be UNK through `` education and UNK pressure , '' says jim UNK , a director of the international mountain UNK association . `` i think we 're making progress . '' few would have foreseen such a furor when , a decade ago , some marin county bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid UNK using fat tires , UNK UNK and UNK technology . they wanted a machine that would allow them to UNK into rugged UNK then UNK to cycles . they got a machine more responsive , more stable and in many ways easier to ride than the UNK racing UNK that then were the rage . when the UNK first entered mass production in 1981 , they were dismissed as a UNK . last year , 25 % of the 10 million bicycles sold in the u.s. were mountain UNK . in california , a bellwether market , they accounted for more than 80 % of all UNK sales . the majority of the UNK never even make it into the high country . city UNK love them because they shift smoothly in traffic , UNK easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing UNK . UNK UNK , population 1,200 , is a UNK of the sport . by one estimate , everyone here under 50 owns at least one UNK . the town is home to the mountain UNK hall of fame and it UNK the annual fat tire UNK week . this summer , the UNK attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town 's winter ski season . david UNK , chairman of the fat tire UNK UNK , UNK that the UNK 's popularity may be a combination of technology and UNK . `` the mountain UNK feels as comfortable as the ` UNK ' UNK you had as a kid , but it can do so much more , '' he says . the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission : canada 's province of UNK UNK , shelf offering of up to $ 550 million of debentures .

UNK fears a huge wave of treasury borrowing early next month will drive down treasury bond prices . that , coupled with poor third-quarter UNK comparisons , `` will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months , '' he says . but several other traders contend investors have UNK to junk-bond jitters , and that stock prices will continue to recover . `` they shot the whole UNK just because the piano player hit a bad note , '' said UNK UNK , president of UNK associates inc. , referring to the stock market 's plunge friday on news of trouble in financing the ual corp . buy-out . in major market activity : treasury bond prices fell . the yield on 30-year treasury bonds climbed back above 8 % , ending the day at 8.03 % . the dollar was mixed . late yesterday in new york , the dollar rose to 142.75 yen from UNK yen monday , but fell to 1.8667 marks from UNK marks . the consumer news and business channel cable network and u.s. news & world report have formed a joint venture to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine . the programs will run on the cable network the sunday evening immediately prior to the release of the special issue of u.s. news & world report .

UNK co. reported a one-time gain and strong UNK sales that offset weakness in pulp and paper to fuel a 15 % jump in third-quarter net income to $ UNK million , or 78 cents a share . in the 1988 third quarter , the forest-products company reported profit of $ UNK million , or 69 cents a share . sales rose 9 % to $ UNK billion from $ UNK billion . for the nine months , the company posted a 14 % rise in profit to $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , from $ UNK million , or $ 1.95 a share . sales rose 9 % to $ UNK billion from $ UNK billion . results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $ 33 million from the company 's business improvement and UNK program , and a gain of $ 49 million on the sale of a subsidiary 's common stock . forest-products operations strengthened in the third quarter , while paper operations were dogged by higher costs , soft newsprint exports and a strong japanese yen . some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business . UNK 's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months , but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs , plus pricing of certain products , the company said . looking ahead to the fourth quarter , the company said export UNK and lumber markets will be weak , while panel and plywood markets will be stronger . pulp and paper performance depends on cost and price UNK , the company said . bankers trust new york corp. became the latest major u.s. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries , making a $ 1.6 billion third-quarter addition to its provision . the bank also said it expects to report a $ 1.42 billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year . the new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to third world countries to $ 2.6 billion , or 85 % of bankers trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries . `` step up to the plate and take the big swing . get the problem behind you and do n't look back , '' said james j. UNK , analyst at keefe , bruyette & woods , in approving of the move . bankers trust `` has had the capacity to do this for some time , '' the analyst said . he expects citicorp to take a similar step this year . citicorp yesterday reported a 9 % third-quarter earnings drop , which analysts called a bit disappointing , while manufacturers hanover corp. posted a $ UNK million loss for the quarter after adding $ 950 million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries . three other major u.s. banks posted earnings increases . wells fargo & co. of san francisco posted a 17 % jump . UNK financial corp. , the parent of pittsburgh national bank , reported net income climbed 9.8 % , while net for banc one corp. of columbus , ohio , grew 3.8 % . citicorp analysts were only slightly disappointed by citicorp 's numbers . `` there 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said UNK UNK , analyst for c.j. lawrence , morgan grenfell inc . earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew 27 % . `` the consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , '' said mr. UNK of keefe , bruyette & woods . corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the bank said , and profit for the area sank 27 % . the UNK loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and UNK payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from argentina in the nine months and none from brazil in the third quarter , while UNK brought itself `` substantially current . '' overall , the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ 70 million from $ 80 million a year earlier . `` people were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries , a citicorp spokesman said . but he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ 2.6 billion , covering about 30 % of the $ 8.9 billion of such loans outstanding . ronald i. UNK , analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. , called citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ 93 million before taxes `` strong . '' a `` concerning '' item the analyst cited was the 10 % jump in expenses , which the bank UNK to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business . citicorp 's spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth . wells fargo wells fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks , UNK a drop in net interest margin with 13 % third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages . its margin fell only seven basis points , or UNK of a percentage point , from a year ago , compared with a UNK drop at security pacific corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country . as a result , wells fargo 's net interest income rose $ UNK million , or 7 % , to $ UNK million for the quarter . UNK income fell slightly to $ UNK million from $ 193.3 million , while wells fargo continued to UNK control UNK expense , which was almost flat at $ UNK million . the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave wells fargo a 1.25 % return on average assets for the quarter , about 40 % higher than security pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the u.s. . wells fargo 's return on equity increased to UNK % from UNK % . wells fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell 8 % from the previous quarter to $ UNK million from $ UNK million . but the amount was still 39 % higher than the year-ago level , and 25 % higher as a percentage of total loans . that trend , and wells fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs , are about the only worries analysts have about wells fargo 's financial picture . wells fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve , which increased to $ UNK million at sept. 30 from $ UNK million the previous quarter but was down from $ UNK million a year ago , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans . manufacturers hanover manufacturers hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a one-time $ 16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , third-quarter earnings were $ 75 million . the comparable year-earlier number was $ 56 million , a spokesman said . the bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ 2.4 billion , covering 36 % of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations . the net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter , as did certain areas of wholesale banking . fees from syndicating loans dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . `` we did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in the quarter `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said . expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4 % , to $ 541 million . UNK financial UNK financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs . net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4 % , to $ UNK million . trust income grew 15 % , to $ 49.9 million , while service charges , fees and commissions increased 22 % , to $ UNK million . the bank 's total allowance for credit losses was $ UNK million , or 1.82 % of total loans . prime minister UNK UNK set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling congress -lrb- i -rrb- party control of the government . other analysts say the indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties . elections in this large , diverse and passionate nation are always hard to predict . much depends on the opposition , a loose group of regional and UNK parties led by former UNK cabinet minister UNK UNK UNK . the biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against mr. UNK and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs , promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity . yesterday , four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party , mr. UNK called elections for the lower house of parliament on nov. 22 and 24 . the elections will be held in different states on one of the two days . -lrb- the lower house 's five-year term expires in january ; the parliament 's upper house is appointed . -rrb- the elections will be a UNK test for the 45-year-old prime minister and congress -lrb- i -rrb- , which in various forms has ruled for 40 of india 's 42 years of independence . after a UNK win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother , UNK UNK , mr. UNK saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride . his early promises to make india a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy . his pledge to clean up local administration and indian politics , including his own party , went unfulfilled . his `` mr. clean '' image was UNK by an UNK scandal , which will be a major campaign issue . some analysts predict that disappointment in mr. UNK 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and UNK local government will crest at the polls . `` there 's a wide feeling of UNK across the country , '' says UNK sen UNK of the center for policy research , in new UNK . `` i think the people will be judging the regime by a UNK UNK , by a corrupt revenue UNK . this could be a big protest against an administrative failure . '' even if the congress -lrb- i -rrb- retains control of the government , mr. UNK 's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority . economic analysts call his UNK liberalization of the indian economy incomplete , and many are hoping for major new UNK if he is returned firmly to power . the UNK UNK , or lower house of parliament , has UNK elected and two appointed seats . in 1984 , the congress -lrb- i -rrb- captured 405 seats , the largest victory in the history of indian democracy . the UNK was fueled by panic that prevailed in india at the time . mrs. UNK had been UNK by UNK UNK , and many UNK feared their country might split apart . in the previous three general elections , similar national issues UNK the vote . in 1971 , the congress party won after india 's victory in the UNK war . in 1977 , mrs. UNK was thrown out of office after her UNK emergency rule , and in 1980 , after her successors made a mess of their three years in power , she was restored to office . most political analysts say that if mr. UNK 's opposition UNK to field single candidates in most UNK , the congress -lrb- i -rrb- will lose big . but if the opposition remains fractured , the congress -lrb- i -rrb- could win a small majority , or lead a coalition government . UNK UNK , a UNK and former UNK UNK , predicts congress -lrb- i -rrb- will win only 150 seats , a quarter of the house , if the opposition fields single candidates in 80 % of the races . analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to UNK , and its success will be clear only when it UNK its final list of parliamentary candidates . the UNK scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign , but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average indian voters . in 1986 , india signed a $ 1.4 billion contract with ab UNK , a unit of nobel industries sweden ab , to purchase 400 UNK pieces . the contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers , and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs . in april 1987 , evidence surfaced that commissions were paid . the opposition charged that the money was used to bribe indian government officials , an UNK denied by mr. UNK 's administration . but many of his statements on the issue in parliament subsequently were proven wrong by UNK evidence . the scandal has faded and UNK , but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages , and that has helped UNK the opposition , which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills . it was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated . in a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone , a job , and even into a school , the name UNK has become a potent UNK cry against the government . that illustrates the kind of disappointment many UNK feel toward mr. UNK , whom they UNK elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power . his term has produced no spectacular failures in politics , in the economy or on the military front , and has UNK up some successes . but the average indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt . his failures in those two areas deeply , and sometimes bitterly , disappointed many UNK . `` we do n't like the congress -lrb- i -rrb- , '' says UNK UNK , a farmer in the western state of UNK . `` the congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support . when there are well problems , light problems , road problems , the government tells us to forget it . '' the greatest thing going for mr. UNK and the congress -lrb- i -rrb- party is the poor reputation of the opposition . even if it UNK for the elections , its UNK is likely to be temporary . when the congress -lrb- i -rrb- lost the 1977 election , following mrs. UNK 's UNK emergency rule , a similar coalition took power and then UNK . many UNK fear a repeat of that experience . march 24 , 1986 : ab UNK , a unit of nobel industries sweden ab , enters into a $ 1.4 billion contract with india 's defense ministry to supply 400 UNK UNK UNK field UNK UNK . in 1985 , prime minister UNK UNK , in his talks with then swedish prime minister UNK UNK , imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen . april 16 , 1987 : swedish national radio reports that about $ 40 million -- nearly 3 % of the total contract -- was paid by UNK as commissions to middlemen . june 1 , 1987 : sweden 's national audit bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $ 40 million to UNK UNK . the report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from UNK . UNK says it ca n't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would UNK industrial UNK . a portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements . aug. 6 , 1987 : prime minister UNK tells the indian parliament , `` ... neither i nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions . that is the truth . '' aug. 26 , 1987 : UNK admits payments of $ 41 million to middlemen . april 22 , 1988 : the UNK newspaper publishes UNK of bank documents for foreign-exchange UNK and letters between UNK and certain private companies related to the sale of the UNK to india . april 26 , 1988 : a parliamentary UNK committee dominated by the congress -lrb- i -rrb- party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any indian individual or company . july 18 , 1989 : the comptroller and UNK of india reports serious UNK in the government 's technical and financial evaluation of the UNK deal . sept. 15 , 1989 : retired army chief of staff UNK UNK UNK in an interview that he suggested in may 1987 that the government cancel the UNK contract . according to gen. UNK , that would have forced UNK to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company . his recommendation was rejected by the government . oct. UNK 1989 : the UNK newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the swedish national audit bureau 's report . the disclosures state that commissions were paid by UNK to an indian agent of the arms company . UNK partnership ltd. and UNK partners UNK said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of UNK international inc . in a filing with the securities and exchange commission , UNK and UNK , which together hold UNK % of UNK 's common shares , said they think it is in the best interest of UNK stockholders that the company be sold . UNK , based in UNK , va. , said it had n't seen the filing by UNK and UNK and therefore had no comment . the partnerships said they may seek board representation , and they may seek the support of UNK 's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans . according to the filing , UNK and UNK are based in UNK , neb. , and are controlled by the same general partner , alan s. UNK . their combined stake consists of UNK UNK common shares , including UNK shares bought in the past 60 days at $ UNK to $ UNK a share . additional shares may be bought or sold in the open market , in private transactions or otherwise , depending on market conditions and other factors . the UNK trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices . but bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market . in early trading , investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears UNK that friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated . but a partial recovery in the dow jones industrial average , which had been down more than 60 points in UNK , UNK those expectations . treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ 4 billion offering by the tennessee valley authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt . `` bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall , '' said roger early , a vice president at UNK investors inc. , pittsburgh . `` when stocks stabilized , that was a disappointment . '' meanwhile , for the second straight day , the bond market paid little attention to the federal reserve 's open market operations . fed officials UNK more cash into the banking system by arranging $ 1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual UNK intervention period . the move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence . `` the intervention has been friendly , meaning that they really did n't have to do it , '' said UNK fiorini UNK , money-market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc . she said a more aggressive move was n't needed . the fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further . it already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1\\/4 percentage point to about 8 3\\/4 % from its previous target level of about 9 % . the rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy . it ended at about 8 11\\/16 % yesterday , but was as low as 8 1\\/2 % monday . the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1\\/2 point , or over $ 5 for each $ 1,000 face amount , while the yield moved above 8 % for the first time since thursday . investment-grade corporate , municipal and mortgage-backed securities also fell . but most junk bonds closed unchanged after opening slightly higher on UNK by institutional investors . some so-called high-quality junk issues , such as UNK UNK & co. 's 14 1\\/2 % subordinated debentures , rose . the UNK 's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97 . the UNK 's public debt offering was its first in 15 years . strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion . traders said UNK related to the UNK pricing also pressured treasury bonds . `` underwriters of the UNK bonds reduced their market risk by selling treasurys to cover at least part of their -lcb- UNK -rcb- holdings , '' said james r. UNK , a senior vice president at shearson lehman government securities inc . the UNK bonds also `` served to UNK the market that there will be even more new supply , '' said lawrence n. UNK , a managing director at s.g. warburg securities & co . today the treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and resolution funding corp. will announce details of its first bond offering . some traders estimate $ 9.75 billion of new two-year treasurys will be sold next week , and they expect refcorp to offer $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion of long-term `` bailout '' bonds . refcorp was created to help fund the thrift bailout . another agency issue came to market yesterday . the office of finance of the federal home loan banks said it priced a four-part $ UNK billion bond offering for the banks to yield from UNK % to 8.375 % . the release of several economic reports had little impact on the market , including a report that the u.s. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $ UNK billion in august , up from a revised $ UNK billion in july . the august gap was expected to have expanded to $ 9.1 billion . treasury securities treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1\\/2 point lower . the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 100 28\\/32 to yield 8.04 % , compared with 101 19\\/32 to yield UNK % monday . the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 99 25\\/32 to yield 8.01 % , compared with 100 1\\/32 to yield UNK % . short-term rates increased . the discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52 % for a UNK yield of 7.75 % . the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53 % for a UNK yield of UNK % . corporate , other issues investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1\\/4 to 1\\/2 point lower , while most junk bonds ended unchanged . the UNK 's huge $ 4 billion offering dominated attention in the new-issue market . UNK offered $ 2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield UNK % ; $ 1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42 % ; and $ 1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield UNK % . the UNK , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation wholly owned by the u.s. government . yesterday 's bond sale was part of a $ 6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the UNK owes the federal financing bank , an arm of the treasury . meanwhile , lockheed corp. priced a $ 300 million note offering to yield UNK % . mortgage-backed securities the derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief UNK as two new remics totaling $ 850 million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today . the UNK of the real estate mortgage investment UNK market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading . dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new remics when prices are moving widely . the two remics priced were a $ 500 million federal home loan mortgage corp. issue underwritten by salomon brothers inc. and a $ 350 million federal national mortgage association deal underwritten by greenwich capital markets . the remic issuance supported prices of freddie mac and fannie mae securities , which held up better than government national mortgage association securities during an afternoon sell-off . ginnie mae 9 % securities for november delivery ended at 97 29\\/32 , down 7\\/32 ; 9 1\\/2 % securities at 99 31\\/32 , down 6\\/32 ; and 10 % securities at 101 29\\/32 , down UNK . freddie mac 9 % securities were at 97 UNK , down UNK . the ginnie mae 9 % issue was yielding UNK % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the treasury 10-year note held at 1.42 percentage points . municipals confusion over the near-term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena , as gyrations in the stock market continued to buffet bonds . long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3\\/8 point lower after a UNK session of moving UNK to stocks in modest UNK trading . prices of UNK municipal bonds were capped by news that chemical securities inc. , as agent for a customer , will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues . the lists total $ UNK million . UNK bonds are called at their earliest call date with the UNK proceeds of another bond issue . meanwhile , several new issues were priced . underwriters led by painewebber inc. set preliminary pricing for $ UNK million of california health facilities financing authority revenue bonds for kaiser UNK . tentative UNK yields were set from 6.25 % in 1993 to UNK % in 2018 . as part of its college savings plan , connecticut offered $ UNK million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25 % in 1994 to 6.90 % in 2006 , 2007 and 2009 . a chemical securities group won a $ 100 million UNK general obligation veterans ' tax note issue due nov. 1 , 1990 . the 6 3\\/4 % notes yield 6.25 % . foreign bonds west german government bond prices took a wild roller-coaster ride , pulled down by monday 's u.s. stock market gains then up by a UNK u.s. trade deficit and falling u.s. stock prices . west germany 's 7 % bond due october 1999 was at UNK late yesterday , off 0.10 point from monday , to yield 7.01 % . the 6 3\\/4 % notes due april 1994 were up 0.10 point to UNK to yield UNK % . british government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market . the treasury 11 3\\/4 % bond due 2003\\/2007 rose UNK to 112 10\\/32 to yield 10.03 % . but japanese bonds ended weaker . the benchmark no. 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at a price of 96 , off UNK point to yield UNK % . a house-senate conference approved an estimated $ 67 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that provides a 28 % increase for space research and development and UNK far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market . the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal housing administration would be increased to $ UNK . separately , the bill gives authority to the bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and UNK homeowners . the second provision , affecting so-called 235 mortgages , has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the public securities association . and a UNK of influential former senate aides employed by the wall street firm salomon brothers came to the capitol in a UNK attempt to strip the provision . by an UNK margin , senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan , and despite powerful allies , the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives . the government currently is subsidizing an estimated UNK loans above 11 % under the 235 program , and however UNK to private investors , the refinancing is expected to yield at least $ 15 million in savings in fiscal 1990 . this sum has been UNK UNK by UNK anxious to offset spending elsewhere , and conservative sen. phil UNK cast the fight as a UNK stand against UNK interests . `` we are UNK here , not of the mortgage companies , but the taxpayers , '' said the texas republican . the action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $ 9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in nicaragua in february . the bulk of the money would be UNK through the national UNK for democracy , but the legislation is so UNK written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate UNK . the senate had refused late friday to UNK UNK and limit debate , but behind the UNK leadership , a solid majority took shape yesterday and UNK aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties . final approval -- on a UNK roll call -- was never in doubt , but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators , including republicans UNK UNK and warren rudman and democrats bill bradley and john glenn . the money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring , but more than half is likely to go to the union UNK UNK party . critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing , and one irony is that under nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's supreme electoral council . within the appropriations conference yesterday , the $ 67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a UNK collection of accounts for science , housing , veterans and the environment . the decision to raise the ceiling on fha home loans still faces strong opposition in the house . but it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various UNK devices to UNK as much as $ 1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget . these costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991 , and the measure further UNK congress to a set of costly projects , including the first construction funds for the space station . the station is promised $ 1.8 billion within the $ UNK billion provided for research and development in the national aeronautics and space administration , and the nation 's UNK aerospace plane -- cut by the senate -- could receive as much as $ 60 million in new funds or UNK . similarly , the house agreed to add back $ 62 million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite , being developed by general electric co . and while setting a UNK limit of $ 1.6 billion on the automated space probe , the conference appropriated $ 30 million for the start-up of the UNK mission , a successor to the voyager space probe . among major domestic agencies , the environmental protection agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration , with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14 % to about $ UNK million . an estimated $ UNK billion is separately allocated for the national science foundation , and within the housing and urban development department , more than $ 9.2 billion is provided for federally UNK housing , including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the UNK families . to an unusual degree , the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to UNK funds for projects in home states . while the practice was discouraged in the past , the conference agreement is laced with veterans ' hospitals , environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities . the most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds , where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $ 20 million , and the conference added 15 more valued at $ 8 million to UNK preserve `` balance '' between the house and senate . yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week , as UNK approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late monday that includes a sweeping ban on UNK on most domestic airline flights . an exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to hawaii and UNK , but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about 30 flights would be covered . separately , a third conference report covering an $ 18.4 billion treasury and postal service bill was sent to the senate after passing the house on a UNK roll call yesterday . and after weeks of delay , the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape . defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint . and among domestic programs , the most serious threat is white house opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the district of columbia and department of health and human services . the same issue threatens to UNK over to the foreign aid debate , and mr. bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that preserves senate-passed provisions UNK u.s. support for the united nations fund for population activities . in a sharply written letter , rep. david UNK , chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations , warned mr. bush that the result of his `` UNK '' could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere . `` as a result of your UNK , '' writes the wisconsin democrat , `` i guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference , UNK regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill . markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge . gold , which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time , yesterday achieved what may be a new level of UNK : the most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market . the settlement prices of the december , february and april gold contracts were even with monday 's final prices . the december 1989 contract , which has the greatest trading volume , ended at $ UNK an ounce . the other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce . according to one analyst , bernard savaiko of painewebber , new york , the stock market 's ability on monday to rally from last friday 's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either -- took the UNK out of precious metals prices , and out of gold 's , in particular . yesterday , gold traded within a narrow range . gold tried to rally on monday but ran into the same situation that has UNK gold prices for more than a year : selling by gold producers , who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold . `` december delivery gold is trading in a range of $ UNK to $ 375 -lcb- an ounce -rcb- and is having difficulty breaking out above that , '' mr. savaiko said . `` producers at the moment UNK that area a good one in which to sell gold . '' also , mr. savaiko noted , stock market investors seeking greater safety are UNK toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because `` we are UNK more toward a UNK economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive . '' jeffrey UNK , president of UNK canada , toronto precious metals advisers , said there is little to UNK gold traders to buy the metal . `` investors in the u.s. and europe are comfortable with the actions of the -lcb- federal reserve -rcb- in its UNK to supply liquidity to financial system , which helped the stock market rebound on monday , '' he said . there is n't any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold , he said . `` they still bear the memory of october 1987 , when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell , '' mr. UNK said . `` it 's an experience they do n't want to repeat . '' at the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation , he said , and as for the dollar , `` gold 's association with the currency has been UNK recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold . '' UNK UNK , chief bullion trader for chase manhattan bank , said : `` there is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety ' quality . there is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher , it may be just a false alarm . this is keeping the gold traders UNK . '' the most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ UNK an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold , mr. UNK said . `` i do n't know what it means over the long run , but for the short term , it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $ 10 or so that gold has risen over the past week or so , '' he said . previously , he noted , gold producers tended to back off from a rising gold market , letting prices rise as much as possible before selling . mr. UNK observed that the u.s. merchandise trade deficit , which rose sharply in august , according to yesterday 's report , has been having less and less impact on the gold market . `` the dollar has n't reacted much to it , so gold has n't either , '' he said . in other commodity markets yesterday : energy : crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried to assess action in the stock market . since stock market indexes plummeted last friday , participants in all markets have been wary . when traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized , oil prices are expected to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration . crude oil for november delivery edged up by 16 cents a barrel to $ UNK a barrel . heating oil prices also rose . november gasoline slipped slightly . UNK : futures prices rose on a report that cuba may seek to postpone some UNK shipments . the march contract advanced UNK cent a pound to UNK cents . according to an analyst , cuba ca n't meet all its UNK commitments and has asked japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year , into early next year . `` japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the UNK , '' the analyst said . it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices , the analyst said . another analyst noted that cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years . `` to the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise . the march futures contract traded as high as UNK cents , but could n't sustain the advance , '' he said . livestock and meats : the prices of cattle , UNK and pork UNK futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the friday stock market plunge would UNK consumer spending , which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork . the prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply monday . cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef . UNK and UNK : the prices of most soybean and UNK futures contracts rose amid rumors that the soviet union is interested in buying from the u.s. or south america about 250,000 metric tons of UNK and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean UNK . traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible u.s. soybean sales because u.s. exports are lagging . since sept. 1 , about 13 million fewer bushels of u.s. UNK have been sold overseas than for the same period last year . corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed . moody 's investors service inc. , fretting about increasing competitive pressure on UNK , placed about $ 2.8 billion in company securities under review for possible downgrade . ratings under review are UNK 's UNK collateral trust debentures , UNK senior notes and bonds , UNK preferred stock and the company 's UNK rating for commercial paper . moody 's said it is assessing the strategies UNK 's management may follow in addressing significant challenges in some major markets . the rating agency said it is focusing especially on the transportation service company 's efforts to control costs , improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business , vehicle leasing and rental . the nations of southern africa know a lot about managing elephants ; their herds are thriving . but the nations of europe and north america have decided they know better . at this week 's UNK conference in UNK , they imposed a global UNK ban that seeks to overturn local policies . a UNK delegate argued that the ban would `` guarantee the UNK of the UNK . '' legitimate ranchers , who have an interest in preserving the herds , would go out of business . UNK would control the underground trade . many delegates were willing to craft a compromise , but u.s. delegate UNK harriman and others UNK that down . the greens from the first world wanted a UNK play , not a UNK . fortunately , the nations of southern africa have n't totally surrendered their sovereignty . five countries announced they would not honor what one UNK delegate UNK called the `` made in switzerland '' solution . in fact , they seemed a UNK UNK . the director of UNK 's UNK department described american UNK as `` fat little UNK from urban environments who do n't know a thing about africa . '' that 's not fair ; they 're not all fat . UNK UNK generates pleas for aid from south carolina small businesses . the small business administration has received more than 5,000 formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane . about 45 % of requests for UNK relief loans , which also are available to homeowners , come from small businesses , compared with a 25 % business share after most disasters . the UNK expects to make about $ 1 billion in hurricane hugo loans . the disaster fund is replenished by loan UNK . hardest hit by hugo in south carolina were small retailers tied to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and UNK seafood . the state development board set up a hugo hotline to accept UNK help . after nbc weather man UNK scott broadcast the UNK number , it was flooded with 10,000 calls . last week , the u.s. chamber of commerce began using its national tv show to seek help , such as equipment , for business owners . local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms . `` it helps us , and people feel better talking to someone who 's gone through the same thing , '' an UNK official says . health benefits remain a central lobbying effort , even as section 89 UNK . the senate , after UNK section 89 repeal from its deficit-reduction bill , still is expected to join the house in voting to kill the law , which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike . in lobbying on other UNK topics , the national federation of independent business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a 100 % tax deduction for their own health plans , up from 25 % currently . and the group will urge that the federal government UNK state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance . small-business groups also will fight the UNK provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves . and they still oppose as too costly an UNK health insurance bill sponsored by sen. edward kennedy -lrb- d. , mass . -rrb- despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually . there is also worry that the UNK commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward UNK solutions . the section 89 victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals . `` with the repeal of section 89 , we can no longer say they 're discouraging businesses from offering health plans , '' says UNK russell , the chamber of commerce 's small-business advocate . jumping the gun : sen. lloyd bentsen -lrb- d. , texas -rrb- was UNK after a private word to john UNK , lobbyist for the national federation of independent business , resulted in a news release saying that the senate finance committee chairman would recommend repeal of section 89 . even though the announcement was true in the end , it was issued without the senator 's permission . `` i UNK it , '' mr. UNK says UNK . `` it was a timing mistake . '' UNK blues : sen. UNK UNK -lrb- r. , s.c . -rrb- UNK pending legislation to end the preference that the federal prison system gets in selling UNK furniture and other goods to government agencies . small-business suppliers want prisons to stop getting high priority , especially as prison production grows with UNK UNK UNK . last year , the prisons ' sales to the pentagon totaled $ 336 million . repair shops scrap for more access to work on UNK systems . groups representing some independent UNK shops join a compromise on the clean air legislation worked out between environmentalists and rep. henry UNK -lrb- d. , calif . -rrb- . the plan would increase the UNK on UNK systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts . but the UNK on UNK parts would be lowered to two years or UNK miles . the UNK owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the UNK repairs after two years . the repair shops are n't united , however . shops represented by the automotive service industry association and the motor equipment manufacturers association oppose any increase in UNK length . they say the longer the UNK , the longer customers will automatically return to UNK dealers , which then find UNK work that might otherwise go to repair shops . the house energy committee will debate the issue later this month . stan UNK , an atlanta UNK owner who opposes a longer UNK , estimates that the current plan costs him as much as $ 15,000 a year in lost business . small talk : some 70 % of graduates who recently earned an UNK degree say they 'd prefer to work in or own a small company , yet most take jobs with large concerns , says a survey by the foster UNK group , a new york recruiting firm ... . cardinal scientific inc. of UNK , md. , seeks a small business innovation research grant to produce a `` UNK assembly for an army mass UNK outfit . banc one corp. said frank e. UNK plans to retire as the bank holding company 's president effective jan. 12 . banc one said `` it is contemplated '' that john b. UNK , chairman and chief executive officer , will assume the additional position of president upon mr. UNK 's retirement . mr. UNK , 50 years old , was chairman and chief executive of american fletcher corp. , UNK , when that bank holding company merged into banc one in january 1987 . the company said mr. UNK plans to retire because the process of UNK american fletcher into banc one `` is considered completed . '' mr. UNK will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of banc one indiana corp. , the successor company to american fletcher corp. , but will no longer be active in day-to-day management . he will remain on the banc one board . the treasury plans to raise $ UNK billion in new cash with the sale monday of about $ 15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $ UNK billion in maturing bills . the offering will be divided evenly between UNK and UNK bills maturing on jan. 25 , 1990 , and april 26 , 1990 , respectively . tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by 1 p.m. edt monday at the treasury or at federal reserve banks or branches . moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered ratings on about $ UNK million of UNK co. debt , citing the closely held chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization . the ratings concern said it downgraded UNK notes , UNK and certain industrial revenue bonds to UNK from UNK and the company 's subordinated debentures to UNK from single-b-2 . moody 's said the proposed UNK may `` limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential '' and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze `` basic business operations . '' a UNK spokesman did n't return calls seeking comment . UNK , which went private in an $ 8.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $ UNK million in preferred stock and debt securities . when the soviets announced their last soldier had left afghanistan in february , the voices of skepticism were all but UNK out by an international UNK of euphoria . it was `` the soviets ' vietnam . '' the kabul regime would fall . millions of refugees would rush home . a resistance government would walk into kabul . those who bought that UNK are now UNK . eight months after gen. boris UNK walked across the bridge into the u.s.s.r. , a UNK regime remains in kabul , the refugees sit in their camps , and the restoration of UNK freedom seems as far off as ever . but there never was a chance that the UNK resistance would UNK the kabul regime quickly and easily . soviet leaders said they would support their kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did . the u.s. said it would fully support the resistance -- and did n't . with the february 1987 UNK accords `` relating to afghanistan , '' the soviet union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control . the terms of the geneva accords leave moscow free to provide its clients in kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of soviet ground forces -- while requiring the u.s. and pakistan to cut off aid . the only fly in the soviet UNK was the last-minute addition of a UNK american UNK , that u.s. aid to the resistance would continue as long as soviet aid to kabul did . but as soon as the accords were signed , american officials sharply reduced aid . in february 1989 , when the soviets said they had completed their pullout , the u.s. cut it further . not so the soviets . gen. UNK himself said soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the kabul regime . since the troop withdrawal , moscow has poured in an additional $ 200 to $ 300 million worth per month -- nearly $ 2 billion since february , equivalent to the total u.s. aid to the resistance in nine years . this includes what deputy foreign minister UNK UNK UNK called `` new peaceful long-range weapons , '' including more than 800 UNK missiles . by early may , moscow had delivered , for example , 1,000 trucks , about 100 tanks , UNK and hundreds of other combat vehicles . later that month , it added an entire tank UNK , including 120 UNK tanks and more than 40 UNK UNK UNK fighting vehicles . by september , a new reinforced UNK UNK UNK with an additional 300 combat vehicles , 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 UNK UNK troops had arrived in UNK . in the last few weeks , moscow has added UNK missiles , the bomber version of the UNK , UNK UNK aircraft , UNK , which can UNK pakistan 's u.s.-built UNK , and UNK UNK UNK , which can UNK the UNK . moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance . it is well-known that the regular UNK UNK is filled with reluctant UNK . but this is not the entire UNK army , and it is no longer kabul 's only military force . complete units have been trained and UNK in the u.s.s.r. and other east bloc nations ; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned . in addition , the regime has established UNK UNK forces totaling more than 100,000 , including 35,000 UNK troops of the interior ministry -lrb- UNK -rrb- , which still is directed by 1,500 soviet UNK officers . even if not all these forces are committed to the regime , they are now dependent on it . and thousands of UNK children have been taken to the soviet union , where they are UNK for the behavior of their families . since 1981 , indian military advisers have been assisting the kabul regime . in preparation for the withdrawal , moscow , kabul and new UNK signed two agreements for several hundred newly UNK indian experts to replace some of the more visible soviet military personnel . UNK military personnel also have been active in afghanistan since 1979 . the soviets cut a deal with iran : a future iranian role in afghanistan in exchange for iranian support of soviet policy . the deal was UNK by the restoration of the UNK UNK UNK UNK to the UNK prime ministry . moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces . before his assassination in 1988 , president UNK of pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh soviet troops were being UNK into afghanistan even as others were UNK withdrawn . rep. bill UNK -lrb- r. , fla. -rrb- reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 soviet central asian UNK border UNK , UNK UNK from UNK and wearing UNK UNK . meanwhile , the kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as UNK UNK . in this they are aided by years of american , european , pakistani and saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical islamic UNK with leaders whose policies are UNK to the UNK public . this heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better , moderate leaders . in autumn last year , for example , the regime garrison at UNK was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates . at the last minute , however , pakistani officials sent in UNK UNK , perhaps the most UNK and feared of the UNK , with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces . the deal fell through , and UNK remains a major regime base . the resistance lacks not only air power , UNK and expertise but often such UNK as maps , mine detectors , or even winter gloves . experienced resistance UNK wanted to use guerrilla action and UNK tactics to wear down the regime . instead , they were pressured by pakistan 's UNK , the channel for their support , into UNK UNK . they took more than 25 % casualties ; journalists report that they faced UNK without mine detectors . the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the kabul regime , but that it continues to exist and fight at all . last summer , in response to congressional criticism , the state department and the cia said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off ; but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive . for months the resistance has been UNK against air attack . thus far there is no indication that they have been UNK with UNK or other UNK weapons . indeed , u.s. officials have indicated to the press that the UNK of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year . moscow and kabul must have found that information useful . for a decade u.s. policy has been UNK , based on UNK and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf . no settlement negotiated by others can force the UNK people to give up their struggle . a UNK of u.s. military aid would merely UNK them to die in UNK . UNK of a new , realistic u.s. policy is long UNK . ms. UNK , editor and co-author of `` afghanistan : the great game UNK '' -lrb- freedom house -rrb- , directs the freedom house program on UNK asia . nothing stirred the UNK of ronald reagan and his UNK as much as the UNK to aid nicaragua 's contra rebels , or the dream of building a UNK defense shield to knock out soviet nuclear missiles . yet under mr. reagan 's preferred successor , president bush , those two UNK UNK causes are UNK on the UNK . and , surprisingly , little more than a UNK of protest is being heard , even though UNK once UNK fire supporting the contras and the strategic defense initiative . `` the programs have arthritis , '' says rep. henry UNK , a conservative republican from illinois . yet , he asserts , `` you look around ... and you say , ` who are the leaders ? who is going to carry the water ? ' '' it is n't surprising that president bush has n't led a UNK to pump up the contras or UNK . though he UNK supports both programs , mr. bush has n't been a passionate champion of either cause , as mr. reagan was . what 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the bush administration UNK the programs slip down the UNK list . a combination of factors -- a UNK among some conservatives , a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a UNK with other issues -- seem to explain the strange UNK . above all , though , conservative republicans who have UNK both the contras and UNK are reluctant to attack a republican president for failing to do more -- though that reluctance may be UNK . `` we want to complain , we want to say something about it , and we 're going to as it gets worse , '' says rep. dan burton , an indiana republican who has been a UNK contra UNK . `` but it 's like kicking your father in the pants . you hate to do it because he 's your father . '' mr. burton says conservatives ' UNK with mr. bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make them more willing to speak out . of course , neither president bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contras or UNK . mr. bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide UNK aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february . but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels . and the administration 's deal with congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even UNK aid next month , though the committees are likely to let aid continue until february . most analysts think there 's little prospect the contras can be a significant fighting force without u.s. arms , and after the february election their future in any form will be UNK at best . instead of focusing on the contras , mr. bush has switched to urging members of congress -- most recently in a white house meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's sandinista government . the administration continues to support UNK , or star wars , and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program . and just last week , defense secretary dick cheney gave a strong speech UNK `` UNK reasons '' to push ahead with UNK and saying he 'd urge president bush to veto a defense bill with `` UNK '' funding for the program . but the strong pitch by mr. cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to UNK . the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding , and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year . and while the defense secretary is speaking out , president bush himself has n't launched any UNK campaign to UNK up support , as president reagan did . the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original UNK of an `` UNK shield '' UNK the whole u.s. , but rather a more modest version . more UNK to UNK supporters , the bush administration appears to have UNK accepted a new UNK proposal from the soviet union that UNK long-term trouble for star wars . the soviets have agreed to complete a UNK cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on UNK defenses . but the soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed UNK UNK later on if the u.s. does UNK testing or UNK that the soviets think violates the existing UNK UNK . it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for UNK plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed UNK . as a result , frank UNK , a former reagan pentagon aide who now heads the center for security policy , charges that the administration 's `` professions of continued commitment to development and UNK of the UNK program strain UNK . '' still , proponents may be UNK away from more UNK because they sense political UNK have turned against UNK the nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on UNK -- particularly when the public UNK the soviet threat is declining under mikhail gorbachev . in fact , because communism seems to be UNK a global retreat , some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their UNK philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs . `` the short of it is that the most UNK among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing , '' says mitchell UNK , a former reagan white house aide who now is president of the hudson institute . some activists are UNK to raise the profile of the two causes . but they say they ca n't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the UNK . one longtime champion of these programs in congress , republican whip UNK UNK of georgia , is distracted by questions about his ethics , conservatives note . other conservative UNK , like wyoming republican sen. malcolm UNK , a longtime UNK advocate , do n't have the clout with the bush white house that they enjoyed with president reagan . above all , though , proponents say neither the contra nor the UNK cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support . `` for there to be wind in the UNK of any program , the chief executive has to be UNK in the UNK , '' says rep. burton . all this causes rep. UNK to muse about an alternate way to UNK up more enthusiasm . `` what i 'd like to see , if he is up to it , is for reagan to take to the UNK to UNK enthusiasm for UNK , '' the congressman says . we 're sorry to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u.s. civil rights commission . mr. allen , appointed by president reagan , grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies . his recent speech , UNK titled `` blacks ? animals ? UNK ? what is a minority ? '' caused an uproar when its title UNK out . mr. allen 's commissioners voted to call his UNK speech `` UNK , UNK and UNK inflammatory . '' commissioner mary francis berry said it was `` another sad episode in the UNK of the UNK missile who is chairman . '' rep. don edwards , the california democrat , warned mr. allen that the speech would be `` outside the scope of the commission 's UNK . '' thomas UNK , head of the lambda legal defense fund , called the prospect of the speech `` frankly shocking . '' we 've actually read the speech . mr. allen began it with a warning to his UNK , a california church group that opposes rights for UNK . he said that other participants in the conference `` do not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual , '' but that `` i mean to persuade you to the opposite view . '' he recalled to the audience a `` strange , UNK '' UNK he once heard arguing `` now that we have finally recognized that american blacks have rights , we need to do the same for animals . '' mr. allen UNK to this UNK because it seems to `` UNK the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a UNK project of charity , of UNK . '' rights on such a basis , whether for blacks or UNK , are `` UNK UNK , '' he said , subject to being taken back . he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals , not as members of certain select groups . his speech criticized the `` UNK of UNK of protected groups in society '' as opposed to individual UNK or , as he put it , in `` a common UNK as americans . '' instead of lobbying for special treatment , mr. allen said that UNK and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special UNK that would risk `` UNK UNK with government UNK . '' this hardly sounds like an UNK UNK . what 's really going on here ? the three most important things to understand about mr. allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal UNK . mr. allen , who teaches government at prestigious harvey UNK college in california and will remain a member of the commission , has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights . he last made waves when he UNK to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by UNK parents off her reservation . mr. allen quickly ran up against the liberal UNK again , which somehow UNK the UNK concept of `` indian rights '' above the rights of individual UNK . there is a huge divide between mr. allen 's UNK view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups . indeed , the gap is so large that mr. allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate . their UNK of him is no substitute for argument . their effort to run him out of washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement . we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as brave as mr. allen in making the case for UNK of civil rights . bearings inc. said its chairman , john r. UNK , will retire as an officer of the company on jan. 2 . george l. UNK , president and chief executive officer , will become chairman and chief executive upon mr. UNK 's retirement . john c. UNK , executive vice president and chief operating officer , will become president and chief operating officer . mr. UNK , 65 years old , was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and UNK products from 1982 to 1988 . he will continue as a director . mr. UNK , 63 , a UNK veteran at bearings , has been president since 1983 . mr. UNK , 51 , joined bearings in august 1988 from UNK transportation corp. , where he was president and chief operating officer . he has been a bearings director since 1985 . the appointments are part of a planned succession at the company . soviet leader mikhail gorbachev opened a major u.s. trade exhibition in moscow and spent two hours UNK some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as general motors corp. , international business machines corp. and johnson & johnson . at the UNK co. stand , mrs. nelson UNK , a board member , offered him a UNK burger . he did n't bite . the exhibition by the UNK trade and economic council underscores the growing u.s. interest in that nation 's market , though trade between the two countries is a UNK $ 3 billion . the soviet president and his prime minister , UNK UNK , spent the UNK time , about 15 minutes , at the ibm stand , where they got souvenir UNK key rings . at the gm UNK , they barely looked at a UNK cadillac , preferring to talk about cooperation UNK . in beijing , meantime , china opened an international aviation show , but the west 's UNK on military deals and uncertainty about the nation 's stability kept many foreign UNK away . officials said 91 companies from 14 countries , including the u.s. , had UNK , down from about UNK firms from more than 20 countries at the last show in japanese UNK maker UNK industries ltd. was fined two million yen -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- for exporting to the soviet union a chemical solution that could be used in UNK systems . a UNK executive in charge of exports when the UNK UNK UNK was sold to the soviets in 1986 received a suspended UNK jail sentence . judge UNK UNK told the osaka district court UNK 's `` responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in japan . '' sale of the solution in UNK form to communist countries is prohibited by japanese law and by international agreement . a soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on UNK economic control . the newspaper UNK UNK said the committee decided the plan to parcel out economic powers previously exercised by moscow to the country 's 15 UNK `` does n't reflect the radical changes in the soviet federation . '' the committee gave the government until nov. 15 to UNK the proposal . the move reflected the growing confidence of the UNK supreme soviet . scott paper co. said it is UNK a proposed $ UNK million UNK project in UNK because it no longer expects to use as much UNK pulp as previously anticipated . the UNK UNK and pulp mill , which would have covered about UNK acres in the UNK UNK region , had been approved by UNK 's investment board . but it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to UNK UNK 's UNK and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive UNK who UNK them . UNK UNK co. of japan is moving its UNK headquarters and holding company to hong kong to gain from the british colony 's economic advantages and tax structure . with funds of UNK billion hong kong dollars -lrb- us$ UNK million -rrb- , the new company , UNK international co. , plans to acquire 10 of hong kong 's top restaurants . it also intends to set up an international wholesale market with the singapore government next may and to open a department store in UNK and shopping centers in malaysia , taiwan , canada , chicago and seattle by december 1990 . the chain currently has 90 retail outlets in japan , seven in the u.s. , three in hong kong and a dozen more scattered around the UNK . major european auction houses are turning increasingly to specialized sales . christie 's will soon have a sale of UNK and UNK art while sotheby 's is UNK collectors with sales of swiss , german , spanish , australian and canadian paintings . in brussels , hotel de UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK - along with paintings and UNK . berlin 's UNK UNK will auction art works with UNK estimates of less than $ UNK on nov. 25 . the auction house , known for its sales of UNK UNK and 20th century works , is providing `` a service to clients who do n't want to sell just their fabulous oil paintings , '' says UNK UNK 's UNK UNK . UNK auctioneer UNK is less concerned with market UNK than with UNK 's crushing tax and UNK burden . `` everything has to be the same between countries , '' says UNK 's UNK UNK , who is asking clients to sign protest UNK . `` then there 'll be fair competition . '' ending tax-free shopping in the european community after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs , the international duty free UNK said . instead of banning such shopping , the UNK proposed UNK controls to be sure the privilege is n't UNK ... . british and argentine diplomats opened talks in madrid aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war over the falkland islands . britain 's UNK UNK and delegation head UNK UNK called the first meeting `` good , interesting and UNK . polaroid corp. , benefiting from UNK savings , reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ UNK million , or 40 cents a share , after preferred-stock requirements . analysts said the numbers were better than expectations , partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency UNK . however , they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment , and an indication that sales of polaroid 's new conventional film in the u.s. have been sluggish . revenue in the third quarter was $ UNK million , almost unchanged from $ UNK million a year earlier . polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ UNK million for the third quarter , more than double the year-before $ 24 million . charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ UNK million , or 77 cents a share , in 1988 's third quarter . `` i 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand '' for polaroid products , said michael UNK , an analyst with wertheim schroder & co . `` if you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an UNK of revenue , there is n't a lot here to base optimism on . '' alex UNK , an analyst with prudential-bache , says polaroid officials told him yesterday that u.s. sales of the company 's new conventional film product , introduced in the second quarter , have been `` disappointing '' after a promising start . sam UNK , a polaroid spokesman , said `` i do n't know about disappointing , '' but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some UNK , discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already . mr. UNK said the film , one film , is currently carried at about 15,000 retail outlets , including UNK and UNK . for the nine months , polaroid reported earnings of $ UNK million , or $ 1.27 a share . last year , the company had a nine-month loss of $ 15.1 million , or 23 cents a share . in new york stock exchange composite trading , polaroid closed at $ 47 , up $ 1.125 . why is the stock market suddenly so volatile ? yesterday , the dow jones industrial average did a now familiar dance : it plunged UNK points before lunch , with most of the drop UNK in 25 minutes . then , it rebounded to finish down only UNK points . and those swings paled UNK friday 's 190.58-point plunge and monday 's UNK recovery . `` it 's UNK -- that in an hour you can UNK off so much value , '' says stanford UNK , chairman of UNK investment management corp. , boston . and , apparently , it is here to stay . richard bernstein , senior UNK analyst at merrill lynch & co , says , `` my gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while . '' there are many reasons for the market 's UNK : new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options ; computer-driven strategies like program trading ; and crowd psychology . but most are linked by a single theme : liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly . prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are UNK ways to turn over shares at UNK rates and increasingly acting in UNK . `` institutions are UNK animals , '' says peter anderson , who heads the UNK management arm of ids financial services inc . `` we watch the same indicators and listen to the same UNK . like UNK , we tend to move in the same direction at same time . '' and that , naturally , UNK price movements . institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an UNK . but when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed -- markets jump . on monday , for instance , howard ward , a principal at UNK , stevens & UNK , found that `` you could n't buy UNK at quoted prices without paying up . '' and when many firms had to `` pay up , '' monday 's sudden rally was sparked . trading in futures and options , some people believe , can add to volatility . investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks ; that is , a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks . these and other modern trading methods `` tend to promote dramatic UNK in assets , '' says george douglas , first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc . `` it 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy '' -- so that UNK of higher volatility get built into the stock market . one new investment style called `` asset allocation '' UNK portfolio UNK between stocks , bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive . for instance , first UNK corp. , an asset UNK based in UNK , n.j. , said it quickly boosted stock positions in its `` aggressive '' accounts to 75 % from 55 % to take advantage of plunging prices friday . it added another 5 % monday before stocks rallied . when they did , the firm reduced those stock holdings to about 70 % . a classic example of institutions ' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance , now widely discredited . before the 1987 crash , an estimated $ 60 billion in institutional money was managed under this UNK UNK . the idea was to `` UNK '' the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves . but in october 1987 , when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time , they overwhelmed both the stock and futures markets . yet even today , institutions are quietly UNK forms of portfolio insurance by UNK rushing to and UNK in the markets . others are doing `` index arbitrage '' a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures . unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies , all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch . but institutions say wall street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets . brokers do n't deny that . wall street traders say that , with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s , securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock . `` i think everyone 's a little more leery , '' says jack baker , head of equity trading at UNK lehman hutton inc . `` the institutions have driven -lrb- commission -rrb- rates down to the point where it makes no sense to UNK capital , '' says tom gallagher , senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at oppenheimer & co . `` why should i risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance ? all you get is risk . '' lack of liquidity can also result from exchange `` reforms . '' many traders say that `` circuit breakers '' put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday . the circuit breakers caused a UNK shutdown in trading in standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling . `` with the UNK halt , you could only sell stocks '' to cut exposure to the market , says a money manager . `` it was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off . '' `` it was like they put you in a room with a UNK and told you there were three doors to exit , '' said one chicago-based futures trader . `` then they said , ` by the way , two of the doors are locked . ' '' the takeover mania also adds to volatility . ual corp. is a good example . valued as a buy-out target , the airline stock was trading at nearly $ UNK a share . when the deal ran into trouble , the stock tumbled ; it closed at $ 198 yesterday . UNK , ual is now trading closer to its value based on earnings . by contrast , traditional buy-and-hold investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves . scott black , a UNK money manager who heads UNK management inc. , points out that for those who invest on fundamentals , `` the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much . '' some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed . hans UNK , finance professor at UNK university , says the current volatility in u.s. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s , decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced . `` i just ca n't believe that the UNK in the financial market are causing any of this volatility , '' he says . and robert d. UNK , president of asset UNK first UNK , notes that before friday 's tailspin , daily volatility on the new york stock exchange in recent weeks had reached `` historically low levels . '' some people tend to ignore that a UNK move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower . john j. phelan jr. , chairman of the big board , asserts that `` 1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years . '' but the low average volatility mr. phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week . in addition , sanford grossman , a wharton school finance professor , says volatile UNK in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the UNK demands of institutions `` who can go out and say ` i have a billion dollars of stocks to sell . ' '' some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless . in UNK , john maynard UNK wrote that `` of the UNK of orthodox finance none , surely , is more UNK than the UNK of liquidity . '' it leads investors to focus on short-term price movements -- `` a game of UNK chairs , '' he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental UNK . james a. white contributed to this article . the national aeronautics and space administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its galileo space probe , which is to be launched today . charles redmond , a nasa spokesman , said the agency discovered the virus on monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called UNK and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today . although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either galileo or the shuttle , part of the network will carry UNK of galileo data once the craft gets UNK . mr. redmond said the UNK had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared `` UNK data could be UNK for real data . '' he estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to UNK the virus from a computer system . the UNK , among the UNK yet to hit a research network , appeared to affect only digital equipment corp. hardware that uses digital 's UNK operating system . it is unrelated to the UNK virus that last year infected UNK , a much larger network used by researchers at universities , laboratories and government agencies around the world . in the UNK of computer security , the nasa UNK is UNK a computer UNK , mr. redmond said . a UNK UNK in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks . the galileo UNK apparently was UNK on a computer in france UNK up to nasa 's space UNK analysis network , mr. redmond said . nasa said the galileo UNK had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had UNK their systems to reject UNK . but mr. redmond said the UNK hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes . michael alexander , a senior editor at UNK , a trade publication , said he was told that the UNK gets into a computer center by looking for obvious UNK -- such as ones that are the same as the user 's name . if it finds one and gets into the system , it will display a screen when a user UNK on that says , `` UNK against nuclear killers ... . you talk of times of peace for all , and then prepare for war . '' in addition , mr. alexander said , the UNK sends strange messages to other machines at the center -- such as , `` george orwell was an UNK , '' or `` do n't feed the UNK tonight . '' the UNK also looks for UNK UNK that confer more UNK on the user . the UNK are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running . if it finds one of those UNK , mr. alexander said , the UNK will do such things as change users ' UNK to a series of random numbers , preventing them from signing on to the network . nasa estimated that , on monday , about four computer centers were affected . yesterday , the number grew to 40 ; today the number is expected to grow to 100 . nasa said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to UNK were affected and the extent of the damage , if any . anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the galileo space probe to jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft . activists fear that if the shuttle carrying galileo into orbit should UNK , or if galileo itself UNK into the earth during the two times it UNK close to the planet , fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere . so far galileo has been delayed twice , once because of a computer UNK connected with a UNK engine , and yesterday because of the weather . nasa said the galileo UNK had nothing to do with either delay . mr. alexander of UNK said UNK have gone after span before . he said the chaos computer club , of west germany , once managed to UNK span and do such things as change the value of UNK , UNK up some calculations . it is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal UNK in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought . yet it is also UNK that the power to create new UNK belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts . beginning in the early UNK century , with u.s. v. hudson and goodwin , the supreme court has repeatedly held that a UNK power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in british law , would usurp legislative authority under the UNK of separation of powers . that 's the conventional theory anyway . in practice , however , the line between interpretation and UNK of the criminal law long ago began to UNK . in particular , a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising UNK over the past decade . for example , although insider trading has long been criminal , it has never been UNK defined . in 1983 , the supreme court tried to supply a UNK definition in the UNK v. sec decision , which found that liability depended on whether the UNK had UNK his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain `` some personal gain '' and whether the UNK knew or UNK UNK this fact . gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point . consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of robert UNK . prior to a tender offer by UNK for UNK inc. in 1986 , the founder of the UNK 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery . she called her daughter to take her to the bank , who , in turn , persuaded her husband , a mr. UNK , to run this UNK . hearing of this information , the husband discussed it with his broker , mr. UNK , and mr. UNK then bought for his own account and other clients . basically , mr. UNK was a UNK UNK . did mr. UNK , his UNK , breach a fiduciary duty -lrb- and , if so , to whom -rrb- ? did mr. UNK seek personal gain -lrb- and if so , how -rrb- ? or did mr. UNK only hear a market rumor -lrb- which one may UNK trade upon -rrb- ? the line seems UNK thin for UNK purposes . a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty UNK entered by robert UNK , formerly head of arbitrage at goldman , sachs & co . essentially , mr. UNK had invested heavily in the UNK leveraged buy-out , when he was told by another UNK trader , bernard `` bunny '' UNK , that the deal was in trouble . after placing orders to sell , mr. UNK called martin UNK , an investment banker at kidder , peabody & co. , who was advising on the deal , to confirm these rumors . mr. UNK asked mr. UNK who his source was and , on hearing that it was bunny UNK , responded : `` well , your bunny has a good nose . '' the illegal `` tip '' of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market . had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced : was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain ? did mr. UNK have notice of this ? finally , was the information material ? yet , all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue : who is and who should be making the criminal law here ? it is not my contention that either mr. UNK or mr. UNK was an innocent victim of UNK UNK . UNK , both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky . but even if they UNK UNK , reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case UNK extension of the law of insider trading . courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors . UNK UNK examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method . when only civil liability is involved , this method has the UNK strengths of UNK UNK and UNK of UNK . still , case-by-case UNK decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel UNK caused by a UNK on ad hoc -lrb- and usually UNK -rrb- examples . when a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was UNK and so UNK the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct , it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule . thus , a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule . for example , in focusing on mr. UNK 's attempt to gain UNK information about a deal 's collapse , one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin : what if the rumor had been false ? can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly UNK rumor is in fact false ? in the past , not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company , but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts . today , after mr. UNK 's UNK , there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient . in this light , the comparative advantages of legislative UNK become clear : -lrb- 1 -rrb- before it acts , the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision , not just the immediate parties before the court ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the legislature can frame `` bright line '' standards that create less uncertainty than the UNK decisions of courts . although legislative lines can result in UNK -lrb- which explains why the sec has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading -rrb- , UNK UNK inevitably creates uncertainty because of the UNK outer UNK and implications of most UNK decisions . at least when the stakes are high , uncertainty in turn results in UNK , as individuals do not dare to approach an uncertain line closely . the federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid UNK of a federal common law of white-collar crime . in 1987 , the supreme court attempted in mcnally v. u.s. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for UNK criminal UNK . yet , late last year , congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a UNK statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to UNK another of `` the UNK right of honest services . '' at a UNK , this may UNK all fiduciary UNK -lrb- and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee -rrb- . such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem : congress finds it is easier to pass UNK UNK prohibitions , which the courts must thereafter interpret , than to engage in the difficult UNK UNK that are UNK its responsibility . we are confronted less with a UNK power grab than with a legislative UNK . UNK , when confronted with morally dubious behavior , prosecutors will exploit the latitude such UNK statutes give them . over the long run , however , UNK cases will make bad law . mr. coffee is a professor at columbia law school . UNK inc. posted a 38 % decline in third-quarter net income to $ 76.5 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ UNK million , or $ 1.37 a share , a year earlier . the year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $ UNK million from the sale of UNK 's stakes in japanese businesses . without the gain , operating profit was $ 64 million , or 71 cents a share . the telecommunications , specialty glass , ceramic products and UNK concern said the latest quarter included a UNK UNK of $ 600,000 . a year earlier , net included a $ 700,000 UNK UNK . sales rose 14 % to $ UNK million from $ UNK million . UNK 's chairman and chief executive officer , james r. UNK , said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments . but the UNK segment slowed somewhat and consumer products continued below expectations . as for joint ventures , mr. UNK said profit was `` essentially flat '' due primarily to a slow recovery at UNK co. in korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to china . also , profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company 's UNK rate . in new york stock exchange composite trading , UNK closed at $ UNK , down 75 cents . ual , the UNK stock that exploded friday 's market UNK , briefly traumatized traders again yesterday . within 10 minutes after an UNK a.m. trading halt in ual , parent of united airlines , the dow jones industrial average plunged nearly 27 points to a UNK deficit . computer-guided buying then kicked in , and the industrials regained 27 points in five minutes . the UNK moves show that the stock market remains fragile and volatile -- ready to jump at the slightest rumor -- a few days after its shocking 190.58-point plunge . nervous investors continued to limit their buying to blue-chip stocks while UNK takeover-related issues . the industrial average closed down UNK , to UNK . new york stock exchange volume was a heavy UNK shares . decliners on the big board outnumbered advancers , UNK to UNK . ual was watched closely and traded heavily . the stock tumbled 24 7\\/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares . the market is still very touchy about rumors and news on pending takeovers . ual , which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks would n't finance , represents the future of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market - corporate restructuring . an important element of this phenomenon -- the UNK market for junk bonds , used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a UNK over stocks . `` it was a very nervous day , '' said john UNK , partner of the big board specialist firm UNK , UNK . the volatility wo n't end soon . this friday UNK the `` double witching hour , '' wall street 's nickname for the monthly simultaneous expiration of a variety of stock index futures , index options and options on individual stocks . traders are already UNK their seat UNK . previous monthly UNK of the major market index futures and standard & poor 's UNK index options have produced spectacular volatility . `` we are in one of those phases where you are going to get a lot of volatile expiration action , '' said donald selkin , head of stock-index research at prudential-bache securities . investors were buying yesterday , but they were running scared to premier blue chips such as procter & gamble , which jumped 3 3\\/8 to UNK . investors `` are buying stocks that have UNK earnings , '' said edward j. UNK , head of block trading at kidder peabody . along the way , investors dumped takeover stocks and shares of banks that have UNK debt and risky real estate loans on their books . `` these loans are more of a focus than UNK debt now , '' said william UNK , senior block trader at prudential-bache securities . chase manhattan , which sold 14 million additional shares at 40 1\\/8 monday through an underwriting group led by goldman sachs , closed down 1\\/8 to 40 . citicorp fell 1\\/2 to 32 , and manufacturers hanover slipped 3\\/8 to 40 1\\/4 . chase and citicorp 's citibank are involved in the ual buy-out financing . both citicorp and manufacturers hanover reported earnings yesterday . in the first hour of trading , about one million shares a minute changed hands on the big board as big stock-index arbitrage sell programs pushed prices lower . -lrb- in stock-index arbitrage , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks against offsetting positions in futures . -rrb- traders said many of the sell programs are positions being established ahead of this friday 's expiration . aside from computer-guided selling , airline stocks took a UNK as well . the dow jones transportation average fell UNK to close at UNK . amr , the parent of american airlines , continued to retreat in the wake of new york developer donald trump 's decision to withdraw his $ UNK takeover bid . the stock fell 3 1\\/4 to 73 1\\/4 on 3.4 million shares . delta air lines fell 1 7\\/8 to 67 7\\/8 , usair group dropped 3\\/4 to 40 1\\/4 , southwest airlines dipped 1\\/2 to 25 and UNK air group slid 3\\/8 to 24 1\\/4 . but texas air , the owner of continental and eastern airlines , UNK the group 's decline by rising 7\\/8 to 14 5\\/8 in american stock exchange trading . eastern said it is ahead of schedule in UNK its operations after filing earlier this year for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , from which it expects to emerge early next year . philip morris , the most active big board issue for the second consecutive session , was unchanged at 43 1\\/4 on 3.9 million shares . other blue-chip consumer issues also fared relatively well : pepsico rose 1 3\\/8 to 58 1\\/2 ; coca-cola co. was unchanged at 66 3\\/4 ; mcdonald 's also closed unchanged at 30 1\\/2 , and merck rose 1\\/2 to 75 1\\/4 . broader averages also fell . standard & poor 's 500-stock index fell 1.69 to UNK , and the new york stock exchange composite index fell 0.88 to UNK . among the takeover-related stocks that sold off yesterday were disney , which closed down 2 1\\/8 to 121 1\\/4 . philips industries tumbled 3\\/8 to 22 7\\/8 ; hilton hotels fell 2 1\\/2 to 92 and holiday corp. fell 2 1\\/8 to 69 7\\/8 . among other blue chips , exxon gained 1\\/8 to 45 1\\/2 . international paper fell 1 3\\/8 to 51 1\\/2 , union UNK eased 7\\/8 to 25 , chevron gained 1\\/8 to 64 , and eastman kodak closed down 3\\/4 to 44 1\\/4 . the only industry group to show a gain from the industrial average 's record high on oct. 9 is restaurants . among the three UNK groups , with declines of 10 % to 20 % , are airlines , casinos and securities brokers . trading also was heavy in the over-the-counter market . the nasdaq composite index closed down 1.05 to UNK on volume of UNK million shares . `` the environment is a lot more UNK , '' said gary UNK , manager of equity trading at the otc stock firm needham & co. in new york . `` because there is a lot more volatility now , if guys see that they can make a quick 10 % or 15 % profit , they 'll take it .

'' some bankers are reporting more inquiries than usual about cds since friday . `` reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so , '' said steven UNK , a vice president at chemical bank in new york . chemical said deposits monday were about $ 5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock . `` this is no time to be playing in the street ... the dow has more ups and downs than an elevator , '' proclaimed an advertisement monday in new york newspapers , touting lincoln savings bank 's one-year cd . harold jones , lincoln 's chief retail banking officer , said there has n't yet been `` a UNK response , '' although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week . friday 's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for cd UNK , when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way . first national bank of boston , for example , is offering certain new UNK an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month cds . some banks actually boosted yields on the UNK term cds in the latest week . new york 's citibank , for instance , increased the yield on UNK three-month cds to 8 % from UNK % . on average , however , three-month cds at major banks are yielding a UNK of a percentage point less than they were a week ago . average yields on cds aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction . six-month cds of $ 50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02 % in the week ended tuesday , down from UNK % , according to UNK . the yield on six-month UNK fell to 7.82 % on monday , from 8.01 % the week before . meanwhile , the average yield on six-month cds of more than $ UNK fell to UNK % in the latest week , according to UNK , from UNK % the week before . mr. UNK noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and UNK cds , but yields on cds aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding . cds sold by major brokerage houses , which like UNK cds tend to closely follow interest rate trends , also posted larger drops in yields . a six-month , UNK cd , for example , was yielding an average UNK % in the latest week , a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before . in late april , when interest rates were at their recent highs , short-term cds sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks . cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks . `` what happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit '' reported yesterday `` make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise '' any time soon , said mr. UNK of UNK . `` even before the market drop , rates were down about half a percentage point , '' said robert j. hutchinson , senior vice president for retail marketing at manufacturers hanover trust co. in new york . `` that puts pressure on cd rates . conservatives have an important decision to make this fall . at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund , the bush administration announced its intention to decide by UNK the size of the next increase in the imf 's capital base . while the u.s. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ 12 billion or more implicit in the imf 's request for a doubling of its $ 90 billion capital , the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase . this would be consistent with its UNK support for the brady plan and UNK UNK intervention , and with its financial commitment to mexico , poland and others . the imf has several reasons for UNK the increase . its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s . the size and pace of UNK will accelerate further under the brady plan , which promises larger and earlier UNK to approved countries . at least three other factors have encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital . first , it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets , for which it feels some responsibility . second , the world bank 's recent $ 75 billion capital increase -- $ 14 billion from the u.s. -- has left the imf feeling less than first UNK among international financial institutions . third , the imf would like to meet japan 's request for increased ownership -lrb- currently 4.5 % -rrb- . japan has supported a larger role for the imf in UNK debt issues , and is an important financial resource for UNK programs in developing countries . while international politics may argue for the capital increase , there is a clear economic case against it . opponents of the increase argue that the imf practices central planning while supporting UNK governments . they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries , given its original UNK to assist industrial countries in UNK emergencies . opponents show that there are already more funds available than UNK reform efforts . they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting imf debt for UNK commercial bank debt , a bad trade all around . they believe UNK , which addresses the problems of markets , investment climate and management practices , is the key to UNK growth , not the imf 's UNK focus on trade deficits , quarterly targets and government debt . they point at the numerous UNK governments that have inflated , taxed and regulated themselves into UNK under UNK imf programs . decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration , with subsequent authorization by congress . the last u.s. congressional authorization , in 1983 , was a political donnybrook and carried a $ 6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes . the politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous UNK . liberals may support the stabilizing , UNK role of the imf on two conditions : that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns ; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns . conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year . a u.s. decision to refuse the imf its capital increase , or limit it to 25 % , would bring a major change in international economic policy , and could not be taken lightly . commentators would fret over the implications for the UNK UNK process and the stability of world financial markets . because commercial banks and the UNK governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase , a UNK imf mission would leave both feeling UNK . furthermore , a u.s. rejection of the capital increase -lrb- and transfer of shares to japan -rrb- would give japan an argument against future calls for economic UNK . on the other hand , a decision to increase the imf 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of UNK institutions in developing countries . with the increase , even more UNK energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning UNK that generate UNK economic plans . UNK the ante could slow economic development even further , as countries delay UNK steps in anticipation of UNK UNK support . conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline . the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget UNK fighting over the size of the capital increase , rather than its purpose . if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital , then it is UNK on them to speak up now and explain the alternative . mr. UNK directs the republican staff of the joint economic committee of congress . the chicago mercantile exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making UNK trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer . merc officials said gary n. roberts was UNK following the exchange 's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from july to november 1988 . the merc said mr. roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader , david stein . the merc fined mr. roberts $ 15,000 and suspended his trading membership for three years . also , he and mr. stein were ordered to make UNK of $ 35,000 to a customer . mr. stein was fined $ 25,000 and suspended for three years . messrs. roberts and stein could n't be reached for comment . the merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement , neither man admitted , nor denied the alleged violations . neither was among the 46 traders indicted last august in a federal investigation of traders at both the merc and the chicago board of trade . in a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to time warner inc. 's powerful home box office , cable giant UNK inc. agreed to buy half of showtime networks inc. from viacom inc. for $ 225 million . the purchase comes after nearly three years of UNK UNK talks between UNK and viacom , which has also discussed the sale of an interest in showtime with other cable operators . showtime is a distant no. 2 to home box office , and in may filed a $ 2.5 billion antitrust suit against time warner , charging the company and its UNK and american television cable units with conspiring to UNK the pay tv business . UNK has close to 24 million subscribers to its UNK and UNK networks , while showtime and its sister service , the movie channel , have only about 10 million , according to paul UNK associates , a UNK , calif. , research firm . for UNK , the investment in showtime puts it in an unusual position ; as the largest cable operator , with control of close to 12 million of the nation 's 52 million cable subscribers , UNK is UNK 's largest customer . but UNK president john UNK has long been concerned about UNK 's UNK of the pay tv business , and has been eager to keep showtime as a healthy competitor . `` it is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive UNK marketplace , '' mr. UNK said in a statement . in a telephone interview , robert thomson , UNK senior vice president , said showtime 's suit against UNK `` does n't involve us , and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that . '' he added , `` we do n't intend to be UNK into it , '' noting that UNK wo n't play any active role in the management of showtime . linking up showtime with the largest cable operator in the u.s. could sharply boost its subscribers . UNK said it may bring in other cable operators as investors , a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks , such as the discovery channel . additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further . time warner declined comment . in addition to owning UNK , time warner owns american television & communications inc. , the nation 's second largest cable operator after UNK . viacom also owns cable systems , but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems , with less than one million subscribers . the UNK investment is a big victory for viacom 's chief executive officer , frank UNK , and UNK h. UNK , president of the showtime unit . `` this takes any question of showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all , '' mr. UNK said in a telephone interview . the fight between UNK and showtime is particularly UNK because mr. UNK is the former chief executive of UNK , and mr.

'' later , however , the company agreed to meet on monday with the seattle professional engineering employees association after a federal UNK UNK , according to the union . a spokesman for the engineers said the company asked the union to reduce its demands , which included a 19 % pay UNK in the first year and 8 % in the second and third years . the union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers . its contract expires dec. 1 . meanwhile , a federal UNK is scheduled to meet today with boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking machinists . `` it will take several meetings to resolve this , '' said a spokesman for the machinists union . `` we do n't want to bring back something the members will reject . '' machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10 % pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract . it also would have reduced mandatory overtime . investor UNK UNK increased his stake in UNK UNK inc. and cleared the way for additional purchases . it was n't clear , however , whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and new york attorney martin UNK for control of UNK corp. , a san UNK , UNK UNK systems maker . UNK UNK , a computer services company , was spun off to UNK holders in 1985 , after mr. UNK gained control . after mr.

'' it contends that current government policy is failing to stem the aids UNK because it suggests the use of UNK can make sex `` safe . '' but the report says : `` the only safe sex is sex between UNK partners , '' and testing is the only way to learn of infection . hudson 's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $ UNK million a year to test the entire population between the UNK of 12 and 65 years old . in addition , the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who test positive . an unexpectedly sharp widening in the u.s. trade gap for august UNK the dollar lower tuesday , but profit-taking on short positions helped the currency rebound to close mixed against major counterparts . while the market kept careful tabs on wall street 's gyrations , it UNK off a modest downturn in equities to bid the dollar well above the day 's lows . soon after the release of the u.s. trade figures , the dollar plunged to an intraday low of UNK yen . it also declined against the mark but did n't reach its intraday low of UNK marks until two hours later . the unit stabilized about UNK new york time at around 1.85 marks and UNK yen , prompting UNK rumors that the u.s. federal reserve had UNK to blunt the unit 's tumble . the dollar finished at its intraday highs . dealers noted that the foreign exchange market 's initial bearish reaction to the u.s. trade figures was UNK later by a `` UNK reassessment of the data . '' the u.s. commerce department reported a $ UNK billion deficit in august , compared with a revised july deficit of $ UNK billion . economists had expected a $ 9.1 billion gap . the august figure reflected a 6.4 % rise in imports and a 0.2 % drop in exports . marc m. UNK , an economist with manufacturers hanover trust in new york , said that while the figures appear to indicate a sadly deteriorating u.s. trade performance , there 's still enough positive news in the data to justify buying dollars . he said that while the u.s. trade gap with canada has widened significantly , the trade deficit with western europe and japan continues to narrow . and he added that UNK goods exports are still rising . the dollar 's near-term path remains UNK , according to UNK analysts , who characterize the market as `` UNK .

UNK technology , UNK , calif. , called the settlement `` positive , '' since products covered by the UNK patents account for about 20 % of its annual sales . the electronics concern said it already has paid $ 2 million of the settlement to national semiconductor , santa clara , calif. , and will pay the remaining $ 1 million in equal UNK over the next eight quarters . the payments are n't expected to have an impact on coming operating results , UNK added . nbc 's winning streak has been canceled . the national broadcasting co. , a unit of general electric co. , had its UNK UNK UNK as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by UNK , a subsidiary of capital UNK inc . in the ratings compiled by the UNK nielsen co. , abc , which broadcast the world series , topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share . nbc was second with a UNK rating and 24 share followed by cbs inc.

UNK UNK ltd. said it borrowed 215 million dutch guilders -lrb- us$ 102 million -rrb- from a group of dutch institutional investors . UNK UNK , a vancouver , british columbia , forest products concern , said the 8.1 % loan is due oct. 16 , 1996 . funds will be used to repay existing short-term debt and to finance capital spending , it said . president bush will veto a bill funding the departments of labor , education and health and human services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest , the white house said . mr. bush had threatened a veto previously . but he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president . white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said negotiations between bush aides and lawmakers ended monday without success . most lawmakers think it will be extremely difficult for mr. bush 's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed to override the veto . but there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that holds up the $ 156.7 billion funding bill for the fiscal year that began oct. 1 . mr. bush has said he personally UNK of abortions in the cases of rape , incest and danger to the life of the mother . but he has opposed medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest , arguing that those exceptions are UNK so UNK that they open the way for abortions for other women . newspapers : media general inc. intends to sell two of its west coast weekly newspaper chains , golden west publishing inc. and UNK publications , which together UNK 31 papers . media general said it has had inquiries from potential buyers and expects to complete a sale in 1989 . it would n't discuss a price . lee UNK & associates is to sell the chains . j.p. morgan & co. , new york , will help the UNK managers of UNK new zealand ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank 's condition . earlier this month , the reserve bank of new zealand , the country 's central bank , appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors . UNK asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders ' funds of 180 million new zealand dollars -lrb- us$ UNK million -rrb- . UNK is held 80 % by national UNK fund , new zealand 's largest pension fund , and 20 % by salomon brothers inc. , the UNK and UNK subsidiary of salomon inc. in new york . a spokeswoman for j.p. morgan , parent of the bank morgan guaranty trust co. , confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate . the managers said in a brief statement yesterday that morgan will help evaluate UNK 's position and help determine alternatives . the managers do n't expect to complete the evaluation until nov. 30 . an experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the aids virus , a UNK u.s. scientist said . however , that does n't mean they can benefit from the vaccine . its effectiveness ca n't be determined until a large UNK trial is undertaken by the army in january , according to robert UNK , chief of acquired immune UNK UNK research at walter reed army institute of research . dr. UNK 's report on early experiments using an aids vaccine made by UNK inc. of west haven , conn. , came at a meeting of aids vaccine researchers in florida late monday . the vaccine , UNK UNK , has been safely given to 14 people , some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain UNK . `` the conventional wisdom used to be that you could n't UNK the immune response of an infected individual '' by UNK them with synthetic viral proteins , dr. UNK said . `` we 've UNK that you can . '' he said certain UNK developed kinds of UNK associated with early aids . other UNK sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals , he added . one of the UNK of aids remains why infected people produce large quantities of UNK , but UNK nonetheless . cross & UNK corp. said it reached an agreement to sell its UNK division to recently created UNK UNK inc. , a u.s. affiliate of UNK machinery ltd. of UNK , japan . the agreement also includes the purchase of cross & UNK 's warner & UNK -lrb- switzerland -rrb- ag unit by a european affiliate of UNK machinery . cross & UNK is also selling its equity interest in a japanese joint venture , UNK warner UNK , to UNK machinery . cross & UNK , a UNK hills , mich. , UNK maker , said the net sales price of the total transaction is $ 24 million . the UNK division was one of three businesses put up for sale in cross & UNK 's restructuring program announced in july . cross & UNK said negotiations are under way for the sale of another company , UNK . the average interest rate fell to UNK % at citicorp 's $ 50 million weekly auction of UNK commercial paper , or corporate UNK , from UNK % at last week 's sale . bids totaling $ 465 million were submitted , and accepted bids were at UNK % . citicorp also said that the average rate fell to UNK % at its $ 50 million auction of UNK commercial paper from UNK % at last week 's sale . bids totaling $ UNK million were submitted , and accepted bids were at UNK % . the bank holding company will auction another $ 50 million of commercial paper in each maturity next tuesday . UNK s.a. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88 % , and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50 % rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin . the french electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs -lrb- $ UNK million -rrb- , compared with 130 million francs -lrb- $ 20.5 million -rrb- in the corresponding period of operating profit climbed 51 % , to 572 million francs from UNK million in the first half of 1988 . UNK said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group 's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from UNK million a year earlier . there was also a decline in the group 's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before . these movements were offset , however , by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to UNK million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988 . UNK said the sharp rise in its first-half earnings was based on a 15 % gain in consolidated revenue to UNK billion francs from UNK billion a year earlier . rep. lee UNK -lrb- d. , UNK . -rrb- said he and rep. UNK UNK -lrb- d. , UNK . -rrb- are backing away from their proposal to make the treasury secretary a voting member of the federal reserve panel that sets monetary policy . rep. UNK said the bill will be UNK substantially to call for two meetings each year between the fed 's open market committee and the treasury secretary , the chairman of the council of economic advisers and the director of the office of management and budget . the original bill was strongly opposed by the fed and publicly criticized by friends of the fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank 's independence . fed critics , however , hailed it as a long UNK attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy . rep. UNK said the purpose of the meetings would be to `` improve communications and perhaps UNK between the executive branch and the fed . '' fed chairman alan greenspan UNK regularly for lunch with treasury secretary UNK brady and talks frequently with budget director richard darman and michael UNK , chairman of the council of economic advisers . the administration officials do n't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee . UNK UNK co. said third-quarter profits dropped 34 % because of lower prices for UNK chloride materials , the company 's largest product group . net fell to $ 40.1 million , or $ 1.50 a share , from $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , a year earlier . sales for the quarter slipped 2.7 % to $ UNK million from $ UNK million . UNK chloride capacity `` has UNK demand and we are experiencing reduced profit margins as a result , '' said john d. ong , chairman and chief executive . prices for general-purpose UNK UNK have dropped more than 15 % since last december , he said . the plastic UNK is used in a wide range of products , including UNK , pipe and electrical wire UNK . UNK 's UNK segment reported operating profit for the quarter of $ UNK million , less than half the $ UNK million of the year-earlier quarter . third-quarter operating profit of the UNK group declined slightly to $ UNK million from $ 24.9 million . but operating profit from aerospace products rose nearly 50 % to $ 15 million from $ 10.1 million . in new york stock exchange composite trading , shares of the UNK , UNK company fell $ 1.375 to $ UNK . fiat s.p . a. , italy 's leading industrial group , is conducting `` concrete '' talks with west germany 's daimler-benz ag on a series of projects in the aerospace sector , fiat officials said . however , the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded . daimler-benz chairman UNK UNK told milan 's financial daily UNK sole 24 ore that talks are taking place between both companies ' aerospace units . `` while mr. UNK 's comments please us very much , there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry , '' a fiat spokeswoman said . in the interview , mr. UNK said he is thinking UNK of cooperation in the truck sector , but `` in the long run , i do n't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars . '' UNK UNK , italy analyst for county natwest securities in london , said that right now `` the market is n't being influenced by that kind of news , '' referring to the UNK nature of the talks mentioned by mr. UNK and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week . paul UNK was named president , chief executive officer and chairman of this oil and natural gas company . he succeeds john a. UNK , who resigned for personal reasons . mr. UNK had been president of penn pacific 's national southwest capital group subsidiary . mr. UNK will remain with penn pacific as a director and a member of the executive committee . he has also agreed to become president of a new subsidiary to be formed to make future acquisitions , the company said . spooked investors , despite their UNK to dump takeover stocks , should hold on tight to their jaguar shares . that 's the view of some analysts here who argue that britain 's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two u.s. auto giants battling for it . yesterday , ford motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in jaguar to 10.4 % from 5 % . both ford and its rival general motors recently set their sights on UNK significant minority stakes in the british company . ford 's latest move increases the pressure on gm to complete its current talks with jaguar quickly . gm is likely to reach the cooperative operating pact it has been seeking in about two weeks , knowledgeable individuals say . at that point investors may face a long , bumpy ride . a victor in the fight for jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of british government takeover restrictions . the curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15 % of jaguar shares without permission . `` this is an UNK odd takeover battle , '' says london analyst christopher will of shearson lehman hutton . jaguar 's american depositary receipts were up 3\\/8 yesterday in a down market , closing at 10 3\\/8 . -lrb- jaguar 's UNK make the company one of the most widely held united kingdom stocks in the u.s. , with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there . -rrb- jaguar topped the UNK list for the u.s. over-the-counter market monday . and on london 's stock exchange monday , 18.5 million shares were traded , far above the usual volume . ford 's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of monday 's heavy trading . last week , many jaguar shareholders took their money and ran . fears that ford 's UNK might be UNK put jaguar shares into reverse after gm confirmed its friendly negotiations with jaguar . but yesterday 's announcement indicates that ford has n't lost interest . both shearson 's UNK . will and stephen reitman , european auto analyst at the london brokerage firm UNK & drew , recently switched their jaguar recommendations to hold from buy . `` sit tight '' through the coming volatility , mr. reitman suggests , though he concedes that many small investors will find jaguar 's UNK `` too hard to swallow . '' but a crucial point is how ford UNK when gm , the world 's largest auto maker , firms up its proposed deal with jaguar . at the moment , ford executives will say little beyond UNK their desire to raise ford 's jaguar stake to about 15 % . gm is expected to inject roughly # 200 million -lrb- $ UNK million -rrb- by acquiring some jaguar shares , and then win jaguar management 's promise of an UNK 30 % stake . analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models , doubling jaguar 's yearly output of 50,000 cars . jaguar shareholders would have to UNK such a far-reaching accord . ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the u.k. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early . `` i think ford is going to come out with full UNK blazing , '' mr. reitman says . `` ford wants -lcb- jaguar -rcb- very much . '' u.s. takeover-stock speculators , who may own between 20 % and 30 % of jaguar , could give ford enough votes to block the gm deal . gm might UNK . then , UNK . will says , `` you get a bidding war between two very rich , very determined international companies . '' he believes jaguar 's share price could UNK to between # 8 and # 10 -lrb- $ UNK to $ 15.80 -rrb- . `` there 's quite a bit of value left in the -lcb- jaguar -rcb- shares here even though they have run up '' lately , says UNK johnson , a fund manager for UNK safeco asset management . at the moment , he intends to keep the firm 's UNK jaguar shares . the risk is that jaguar 's share price could slump if gm 's agreement with jaguar effectively UNK out its u.s. rival . `` ford 's UNK to attack -lcb- jaguar -rcb- could gradually wane over time , particularly if saab is a reasonably attractive UNK , '' says john lawson , an auto analyst at london 's nomura research institute . he thinks saab-scania ab on friday will announce the sale of 50 % of its car division to ford ; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months . clifford UNK , president and chief investment officer of UNK capital advisors inc. , two weeks ago sold his cincinnati firm 's UNK jaguar UNK at about 10 each , making a UNK profit on a holding purchased at 4 7\\/8 in early may . `` i thought the UNK of -lcb- a bidding war -rcb- happening were less , '' he says . of course , that was before ford 's latest move . jaguar -lrb- otc ; symbol : UNK -rrb- business : luxury cars year ended dec. 31 , 1988 : revenue : $ 1.71 billion net income : $ UNK million ; or 25 cents a share first half ended , june 30 , 1989 : net loss : $ 1.7 million vs. net income : $ UNK million ; or 12 cents a share UNK daily trading volume : ordinary shares outstanding : UNK million note : all figures are translated into u.s. dollars based on current exchange rates . a.f.

UNK plans to remain on the board until his current term expires in april 1991 , a UNK spokesman said . newport electronics inc. of santa ana , calif. , said milton b. UNK , who holds a UNK % stake , requested a special shareholders ' meeting next wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate . mr. UNK 's high technology holding co. of stamford , conn. , acquired most of its stake last august in an $ UNK tender offer for newport , a maker of UNK devices . newport said mr. UNK is asking shareholders to retain only one director , james r. UNK , a newport vice president . the board is n't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors do n't want to serve beyond the special meeting date , newport said . mr. UNK `` is the new owner and wants to exercise control , '' said UNK b. UNK , newport 's chairman . UNK ag , a major swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said that its group sales rose 25 % to UNK billion francs -lrb- $ UNK billion -rrb- in the first nine months of this year , with strong gains in all divisions . a year earlier sales totaled UNK billion francs . positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period , although the company did n't provide figures , as is customary with swiss companies . UNK said it expects a `` substantial increase '' in consolidated profit for the full year , barring major currency rate changes . UNK plc , a british maker of computer hardware and communications equipment , posted a 52 % plunge in pretax profit for the latest year . the # UNK million -lrb- $ UNK million -rrb- in pretax profit for the 12 months to june 30 was down from # 160 million -lrb- $ 252 million -rrb- a year earlier and below market expectations of # 80 million and # 90 million . the slump in profit , which came despite steady sales , was attributed to increased costs for parts and problems with model UNK . UNK 's profit after taxes fell a similarly steep 51 % , to # UNK million from # 105 million a year earlier . sales edged up fractionally to # UNK million from # UNK million a year earlier . microsoft corp. 's earnings growth continued to UNK that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry , as it reported a 36 % jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33 % revenue gain . the redmond , wash. company , a bellwether UNK of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users , reported net income for the quarter ended sept. 30 of $ UNK million , or 87 cents a share , up from $ 36.6 million , or 65 cents a share , in the year-ago period . revenue rose to $ UNK million , from $ UNK million . microsoft previously indicated it would have a strong quarter by forecasting its revenue gain on oct. 4 , causing a $ UNK a share jump in its stock . but its stock jumped again yesterday as it disclosed surprisingly strong margins on those sales . microsoft 's stock rose $ UNK a share in national over-the-counter trading to $ UNK . the stock had hit a high of $ 81 a share early last week but collapsed to $ UNK in the friday stock plunge . the company had been experiencing UNK margins because of increased sales of software applications , which have lower margins than do operating systems . but the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing . as a result , microsoft 's cost of goods , as a percentage of sales , fell 17 % from the year-ago quarter and 13 % from the previous period . the trend drove up the UNK margin -- net income as a percentage of revenues -- to UNK % in the quarter , compared with UNK % a year earlier . microsoft officials said the strong results also reflected continuing high demand for its software applications and operating systems . while it has predicted that overall growth in unit sales of personal computers is slowing to about a 10 % yearly rate , its own products are selling at a much faster rate because many are UNK to the UNK end of the market . that segment continues to post strong UNK gains , while the low-end , or commodity segment , of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines . compared with its previous quarter , the final period of its 1989 fiscal year , net rose 9 % , and sales rose 7 % . control data corp. , minneapolis , signed a joint development agreement with mips computer systems inc. to incorporate an emerging computing architecture in future machines . mips is a leader in what is known as UNK set computing , or UNK , a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software . in joining mips , control data follows several competitors in UNK UNK as a new design approach . digital equipment corp. , tandem computers inc. , nec corp. and group bull , among others , have similar arrangements with mips , based in sunnyvale , calif . control data said it expects its first UNK mainframe machine to be introduced next year . the accord with mips calls for control data to share its expertise in data storage , the companies said . control data also said it is developing what it called a `` UNK '' computer , the UNK 2000 , intended for scientists , engineers and other users of UNK UNK computers .

UNK UNK , a cancer treatment specialist at the national cancer institute , said the test is widely used in research centers but is n't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment . but the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a UNK has spread or returned following treatment , dr.
